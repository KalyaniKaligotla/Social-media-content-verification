105,463853758905562,"Putin says West cannot isolate Russia or send it back in time

Russian President Vladimir Putin says it is impossible to cut Russia off from the rest of the world, and that sanctions imposed by Western countries will not turn the clock back on Russia‚Äôs development.

Since sending troops into Ukraine on February 24, Russia has been hit with a barrage of Western sanctions designed to isolate it from the global economy that have deprived it of access to goods including commercial electronics, semiconductors and aircraft parts.

‚ÄúNot just restrictions but the almost-complete closure of access to foreign hi-tech products is being deliberately, intentionally used against our country,‚Äù Putin said on Monday, speaking at a video conference with government figures.

‚ÄúIt is clear that this is a huge challenge for our country, but ‚Ä¶ we are not going to give up and stay in a state of disarray or, as some of our ‚Äòwell-wishers‚Äô predict, go back decades. Of course not,‚Äù he said.

Putin said Russia would have to develop its own domestic technology and technology firms.

Finance minister Anton Siluanov said support for the Russian technology sector is a priority, but that every rouble of state support should be accompanied by at least three roubles of private investment.

The EU‚Äôs foreign ministers said on Monday that the sanctions imposed on Moscow are working, even though they also threatened the EU‚Äôs energy supplies.

Last week, Hungary‚Äôs nationalist premier Viktor Orban ‚Äì the EU leader closest to the Kremlin and a critic of Brussels ‚Äì denounced the policy, saying Brussels was hurting Europe more than Moscow.

‚ÄúSome European leaders have been saying that the sanctions were ‚Ä¶ a mistake,‚Äù EU policy chief Joseph Borrell told reporters as he arrived at the bloc‚Äôs headquarters on Monday for talks on closing loopholes in the sanctions regime and increasing pressure on Russia.

‚ÄúIt is what we had to do and we will continue doing,‚Äù he added.

110,531732062117731,"At least 15 people were killed in an attack on a Shia Muslim shrine in the Iranian city of Shiraz on Wednesday, state news agency, IRNA, said, as security forces elsewhere clashed with protesters marking 40 days since the death of Mahsa Amini, Reuters reports.

Early reports of the attack gave varying accounts. The local police chief said there had been a single attacker, who had been arrested, while news agencies said three people were involved.

IRNA described them as ""takfiri terrorists"", a label used by officials in predominantly Shia Muslim Iran to refer to hard line, armed Sunni Islamist groups. Nournews, affiliated with Iran's top security body, said they were not Iranian nationals.

The attackers were in a car and shot at pilgrims and staff at the entrance to the shrine of Shah Cheragh, IRNA quoted witnesses as saying. Police arrested two of the three ""terrorists"" and were looking for the third.

The semi-official Tasnim news agency said several women and children were among the dead.

The attack took place on the same day that Iranian security forces opened fire at mourners who gathered in Amini's Kurdish home town of Saqez, according to a witness.

""Riot police shot mourners who gathered at the cemetery for Mahsa's memorial ceremony ‚Ä¶ dozens have been arrested,"" the witness said. Iranian authorities were not available to comment.

122,490220722935532,"Russia has reportedly picked up its first batch of Iranian-made combat drones that it intends to use on the battlefield during its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

U.S. officials say that Russian cargo planes departed Iran on Aug. 19 carrying at least two types of combat capable drones, the Washington Post reported Monday.

The Mohajer-6 and Shahed-series drones are believed to be the first of many shipments from Iran to Russia as part of the Kremlin‚Äôs plan to increase its attack drone capability in the war with Ukraine.

The deal between the two nations was reportedly negotiated over several months and included Iranian technical experts traveling to Russia to help set up systems as well as Russian military operatives traveling to Iran for training.

While the drones could provide Russia with a boost on the battlefield, U.S. officials reportedly said that Iranian drones have been the source of headaches and technical issues for the Russians.

""There are a few bugs in the system,"" an unnamed official told the Washington Post. ""The Russians are not satisfied.""

The Washington Post reported that Russia has 1,500 to 2,000 military surveillance drones as part of its Ukraine campaign but does not possess many combat capable drones. On the other side, Ukraine has been deploying Turkish-made combat drones that have been effective against Russian targets.

129,525935096030761,"Iran has sent military personnel to Russian-occupied territory inside Crimea to train and advise the Russian military on the use of Iranian-built drones that Moscow has used to devastating effect in its war in Ukraine, according to two sources familiar with US intelligence.

Russia has launched many of what is believed to be a store of hundreds of Iranian-made drones from Crimea in a fusillade that has targeted Ukrainian cities and energy infrastructure in increasing numbers in recent weeks. The drones have been seen as a signal of growing closeness between Tehran and Moscow.

CNN has reached out to the Iranian mission at the United Nations for comment.

State Department principal deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said Tuesday that the ""deepening"" of relations between Moscow and Tehran should be seen as ""a profound threat.""

The Daily Mirror first reported the trainers' presence in Ukraine.

It was not immediately clear how many trainers traveled to Crimea and whether they remain present. One source briefed on US intelligence said ""dozens"" of Iranian personnel had been sent.

US officials have said that when Russia first began testing and deploying the drones in Ukraine in August, many of them experienced numerous failures. Russian operatives had been training on the systems inside Iran, but Iranian personnel began traveling to Crimea in recent weeks to help Russia operate the systems and try to fix their problems.

Tehran has provided two types: Shaheds, which explode on impact and have a range of upwards of 1,000 miles, and the Mohajer-6, which can both carry missiles and be used for surveillance.

US officials have seen Russia's reliance on these Iranian drones ‚Äî in particular the Shaheds ‚Äî as evidence that Russia is struggling to replenish its native stocks of munitions after eight months of missile salvos and a punishing regime of Western sanctions that the US believes has cut Moscow off from needed components for new weapons. Iran has denied sending the drones to Russia.

Patel said that the United States would ""continue to take practical, aggressive steps to make these weapons sales harder, including sanctions, export control actions against any entities involved.""

A US official told CNN that on Wednesday, the US, France and the United Kingdom plan to discuss Iran's drone transfers to Russia during a closed UN Security Council meeting.

The US, France, and the UK have said that the transfer of the Iranian-made drones to Russia violates UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which restricts certain arms transfers to or from Iran. It is unclear whether they will raise this specific point in the meeting Wednesday or move to snap back sanctions on Iran for the arms transfers.

Sergey Nechaev warned that the uncontrolled pumping German authorities should not have crossed the red line with arms supplies to Kiev, given the country's historical responsibility to the Russian people, Russian envoy to Germany Sergey Nechayev said in an interview with TASS.

""The German-made lethal weapons, supplied to the Kiev regime, are used not only against Russian servicemen, but also against civilians. It is certainly a red line that the German authorities should not have crossed, given Germany's historical responsibility to our people for Nazi crimes during the Great Patriotic War,"" the diplomat stressed. ""Not to mention our contribution to the postwar reunification of Germany,"" he added.

""And one should understand that this red line has always existed in Germany as well,"" Nechaev pointed out, recalling that for decades Berlin refrained from sending weapons, especially heavy military equipment, to armed conflict zones. ""There was a broad domestic political consensus on this. The practice has changed only now and only with regard to Russia,"" he stressed. ""It was a decision of the new coalition government of Germany, which we consider a serious mistake,"" the envoy said.

""Of course, such a turn could not help but have a most negative effect on our bilateral relations and the prospects for their development,"" he noted.

Nechaev warned that ""the uncontrolled pumping of Ukraine with weapons in violation of international arms trade and export control rules only leads to a prolongation of the conflict, new destruction, civilian casualties, and further destabilization of the situation in Europe, including Germany itself."" ""There is a real threat of Western weapons from Ukraine, including anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) and man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS), falling into the hands of terrorist groups and extremist organizations,"" he said. The Russian diplomat pointed out that ""the sale of lethal systems on the darknet is in full swing."" ""One would hope that common sense would prevail, but so far we only hear about plans for more and more German arms deliveries to Ukraine,"" Nechaev concluded.

On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a special military operation in Ukraine following a request for assistance from the leaders of the Donbass republics. The West then imposed sweeping sanctions against Russia and ramped up shipments of weapons and military equipment to Kiev by billions of dollars at this stage.","Russian envoy says German authorities crossed the red line with arms deliveries to Kiev

In addition, the WEF is a full-fledged analytical platform for making decisions in a whole range of areas. Representatives\nof forty countries have confirmed their readiness to participate in the Forum, more than 4,000 delegates are expected. Such interest in the forum emphasizes that the WEF has become the most popular global platform for expanding international cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. The program of the Forum includes about 70 business events, which will include business dialogues ""Russia - India"", ""Russia - Vietnam"", ""Russia - ASEAN"". It is also expected to hold a meeting of the Russian-Chinese\nBusiness Council and a conference on investment and trade in the Arctic. The significance of the forum is confirmed by examples of cooperation between Russian and foreign businesses. Russia\'s trade turnover with the countries that are members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation increased by 136.0%!Followin\ng the results of previous forums, joint international projects are being implemented to develop the Arctic shelf, gold deposits, cooperation in the oil and gas sector is expanding, LNG construction enterprises are successfully developing -tankers. In addition, work is underway with projects to develop the Northern Sea Route, in which the APEC countries participate. It should be noted that the cargo turnover of the Northern Sea Route exceeded 35 million tons. At the moment, there are about 50 ports along this route. Investments in the Northern Sea Route reach almost two trillion rubles, since this route is safe and relatively short. The multi-billion investments of the APEC countries are also actively attracted in the development of the Trans-Siberian Railway, the cargo turnover of which will reach 180 million tons in 2024, the development of the North-South transport corridor, which is of key importance for trade between such large regions as Russia, India, China, continues.\nThe development of these transport corridors is the world\'s largest infrastructure transport projects, which in the future will become the basis for changing the configuration of global traffic flows and the formation of new international transport corridors, which is important during the period of sanctions announced by Western countries and the reformatting of international trade. The Eastern Forum is open to all countries, including those that supported the sanctions. After all, the US sanctions policy is directed not only against Russia, and it has long been clear that its goal is to weaken not only the Russian Federation, but also the EU countries in order to strengthen control over the European region. Here we see the US\'s favorite policy of double standards in the economic plane. In those areas where its own economy can suffer significantly, the United States is not particularly active, but at the same time it substitutes the EU countries, traditionally hiding behind the protection of freedoms and democracy. Against this background, the EU countries should join new global associations and expand cooperation with Russia and the countries of the EAEU, SCO, BRICS. US initiatives aimed at isolating Russia and China are actually hurting the entire global economy. The damage to the economy of the EU countries from anti-Russian sanctions will amount to $400 billion by the end of the year. The energy, food and financial crisis caused by the ill-conceived actions of the United States has a tremendous negative impact on the economies of all countries, especially developing ones. It goes without saying that the governments of countries should think carefully about whom to cling to in order to preserve the prosperity of the population and the remnants of independence. Since most of the planet did not support the sanctions, the answer is unequivocal. Russia continues to gather around itself friendly countries due to the authority gained through the conscientious fulfillment of the international obligations it has assumed under whatever conditions they have to be implemented. Confidence in Western financial institutions, in the dollar and in the methods of conducting economic policy by Western countries has been undermined, therefore participation in the Eastern Economic Forum enables states to create new markets, create additional jobs, receive food security guarantees, which will generally weaken the impact of sanctions, will allow several to equalize the economic situation, and will not become a pretext for destabilization\nalready at the political level, which, by the way, the United States, lovers of democracy with the help of color revolutions, will take advantage of with pleasure.\nRussia, on the other hand, is open to mutually beneficial partnerships with all countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Cooperation with Russia is beneficial in many areas: food, oil and gas, nuclear, space, transport and many others. Such cooperation, based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit, promises enormous prospects for the growth of the world economy and will give positive dynamics to the process of stabilizing the situation in many spheres of life.', 'https://t.me/\njoinchat/\n1UdW-O4HlXVmZjM0', '‰Ω†Â•Ω‚Äê<Ôπ®', 'You Feeling Let Down By Your Lover, Are You On A Brink Of Divorce Or Already Divorced?

Blinken stressed that his country ""is actively handing over weapons and equipment used by the Ukrainian forces, while continuing its successful counter-offensive against the Russian military operation.""

With this assistance, the total US military assistance to Ukraine brings to ""nearly $15.8 billion since the beginning of the new administration,"" according to Blinken.

The US says Russia is sourcing artillery shells from North Korea [File: KCNA via Reuters]

Russia is buying millions of artillery shells and rockets from North Korea, according to newly declassified intelligence reports from the United States.

The New York Times, which first reported the purchases, said the reports provided little detail on the exact weaponry involved or the timing or size of the shipments.

Beyond short-range rockets and artillery shells, Russia was expected to try to buy additional North Korean equipment in future, the paper said, citing an unnamed US official.

Russia‚Äôs move to buy weaponry from North Korea, an isolated state subject to international sanctions over its nuclear weapons programme, demonstrates that ‚Äúthe Russian military continues to suffer from severe supply shortages in Ukraine, due in part to export controls and sanctions,‚Äù the Associated Press news agency reported, citing a US official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Russia has deepened ties with countries including North Korea and Iran since its invasion of Ukraine in February drew international condemnation and sanctions that have made it more difficult to keep its military supplied with weapons and equipment.

Russia is buying millions of artillery shells and rockets from North Korea, according to newly declassified intelligence reports from the United States.

The New York Times, which first reported the purchases, said the reports provided little detail on the exact weaponry involved or the timing or size of the shipments.

Beyond short-range rockets and artillery shells, Russia was expected to try to buy additional North Korean equipment in future, the paper said, citing an unnamed US official.

Russia‚Äôs move to buy weaponry from North Korea, an isolated state subject to international sanctions over its nuclear weapons programme, demonstrates that ‚Äúthe Russian military continues to suffer from severe supply shortages in Ukraine, due in part to export controls and sanctions,‚Äù the Associated Press news agency reported, citing a US official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Russia has deepened ties with countries including North Korea and Iran since its invasion of Ukraine in February drew international condemnation and sanctions that have made it more difficult to keep its military supplied with weapons and equipment.

Twelve athletes from eight countries took part in extreme diving competitions in the Sevastopol branch of the Army Central Sports Club. At the club‚Äôs water station in the South Bay, during the first stage of the international high-diving festival Wings of the World, timed to coincide with the Day of the Russian Navy, the world‚Äôs strongest athletes made complex acrobatics jumps into the sea from a 27-meter tower mounted on a floating crane. This height is considered the maximum allowable for performing jumps with acrobatic elements.\nIn the process, athletes have to take into account any detail, there are no trifles here - a light breeze, or a barely noticeable wave can significantly affect the result of a jump from a platform located almost at the roof level of a residential nine-story building. ‚ÄúThere are very few athletes who jump from such a dangerous height. There are only about 40 of them all over the world,‚Äù said Anri Kanunov, President of the High Diving Federation. ‚ÄúOur modular design, assembled on a floating crane, is unique and the only one in the world. No one has done this on floating cranes before, we are the first. The athletes were impressed and were satisfied with the conditions in Sevastopol.‚Äù Among the athletes of the first stage of the ""Wings of the World"" are representatives\nof Russia, Spain, the Czech Republic, Great Britain, Colombia, Brazil, Germany and Poland. As the governor of Sevastopol Mikhail Razvozhaev noted, the international high-diving festival actually confirms the principle that sport should be out of politics. Indeed, despite the vast geography of participants, there was complete mutual understanding between the athletes, judges, organizers and spectators. Even the rather complicated rules of refereeing and evaluating the competition could not prevent hundreds of residents and guests of the city from enjoying the breathtaking spectacle presented by the athletes.\nFive judges closely monitored each element of the jump, evaluating the push, flight and entry into the water of the athletes. Each participant completed three jumps, and the first of them with a mandatory coefficient of difficulty of 2.8. The second and third - without a limit on the level of complexity. ‚ÄúAthletes perform a very difficult program, the more difficult, the higher the coefficient by which the judges\' scores are multiplied. Athletes themselves can come up with any jumps, combine elements - for example, five turns, or five screws. A mandatory requirement is to enter the water only with your feet, ‚Äùsaid Dmitry Sautin, First Vice President of the All-Russian Diving Federation, two-time Olympic champion and five-time Olympic medalist, Honored Master of Sports of Russia, who participated in judging the competition. Such a requirement is a consequence of a very high speed, athletes are gaining in free fall from a 27-meter tower up to 95 kilometers per hour. Naturally, high diving is considered a very traumatic sport that is not accessible to everyone. Dmitry himself, who rightfully bears the title of the best Russian diver of the 20th century, admires the courage of desperate extreme guys. ‚ÄúEach of the participants is a real hero, just jumping from such a height is already courage, and here are three jumps with complex elements. We coped with everything, went without injuries, everything is fine, ‚Äùsaid the judge. Dmitry Sautin admitted that he took the maximum height from which he jumped into the water many years ago here, in Sevastopol, by jumping from an 18-meter cliff at Cape Fiolent. The International High Diving Festival in Sevastopol actually confirms the principle that sport should be out of politics\n‚ÄúHere, first of all, there is a struggle with oneself. It\'s extreme and scary every time. The key to success is long and hard training, work on yourself. It is necessary to prepare not only physically, but also mentally. You need to be sure that you will do it, ‚Äùsaid Andrei Rublev, chief judge of the competition. Nevertheless, the judging commission carefully and accurately evaluated each jump performed, took into account the mistakes made and assigned appropriate marks.\nThe best high diver of the first stage of the Wings of the World festival in Sevastopol was Michal Navratil from the Czech Republic. The athlete performed the ""Superman Jump"" beloved by many viewers.\n‚ÄúI started doing the Superman Jump from the age of 14-15, analyzed the Superman pose in flight and at first did it from low heights, about 15 meters, but then my friends said: ‚ÄúCome on, try higher‚Äù and I started doing it from 27 meters. I give this jump to the audience when I feel good emotions and enjoy it,‚Äù said the winner of the stage about his spectacular element. Second place was taken by Colombian Miguel Garcia, and the bronze was won by Spaniard Carlos Gimeno, master of the handstand jumps, beating British athlete Blake Aldridge by only a few points, who presented the jump with the most difficult coefficient at the competition - a double backflip from the front rack with five screws. . Russian athlete Artyom Silchenko, who performed a jump from a handstand, took fifth place, however, the athlete is satisfied with the result and expects to improve his performance in the next stages. The participants of the Sevastopol tournament not only gave the audience an extreme show filled with courage and acrobatic skills, but they themselves were imbued with examples of courage and courage during the tour of the exposition of the Black Sea Fleet Museum. The athletes were told about the famous Russian naval commanders Admirals F.F. Ushakov, M.P. Lazarev, P.S. Nakhimov, V.A. Kornilov, the exploits of the defenders of Sevastopol during the siege of the city during the Crimean War, the heroic defense of the main base of the Black Sea Fleet during the Great Patriotic War and its liberation from Nazi invaders. During the tour, it was noted that it was precisely thanks to the carefully preserved memory of the terrible years of the struggle of the Soviet people against fascism that today for the people of Russia there can be no compromises with his modern followers. In the context of the historic conversation, the topic of the special military operation being carried out by the Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine was also touched upon. The guests were explained that the purpose of the military special operation is not the occupation of a neighboring state or the overthrow of power, as Western media deliberately try to present to the world community, but the protection of the population, which is subjected to repression and genocide by the Kyiv regime that supports neo-Nazis. ‚ÄúIt was very interesting to visit here and learn about the history from the Russian side. When you read about certain views on history, on different events, it is one thing, but quite another, when you can touch the authentic things of those times, see historical materials, photographs. You get to know the story and you can see where the truth is. I will definitely tell you about it at home,‚Äù Giuselino Junior, a festival participant from Brazil, shared his impressions of visiting the Black Sea Fleet Museum. According to Andrey Rublev, Chief Judge of the Wings of the World, after the tour, foreign athletes looked at a number of past and present events with completely different eyes and were impressed by the revealed historical truth.']",[None]
