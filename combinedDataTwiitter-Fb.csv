20207,"Putin says West cannot isolate Russia or send it back in time

Russian President Vladimir Putin says it is impossible to cut Russia off from the rest of the world, and that sanctions imposed by Western countries will not turn the clock back on Russia‚Äôs development.

Since sending troops into Ukraine on February 24, Russia has been hit with a barrage of Western sanctions designed to isolate it from the global economy that have deprived it of access to goods including commercial electronics, semiconductors and aircraft parts.

‚ÄúNot just restrictions but the almost-complete closure of access to foreign hi-tech products is being deliberately, intentionally used against our country,‚Äù Putin said on Monday, speaking at a video conference with government figures.

‚ÄúIt is clear that this is a huge challenge for our country, but ‚Ä¶ we are not going to give up and stay in a state of disarray or, as some of our ‚Äòwell-wishers‚Äô predict, go back decades. Of course not,‚Äù he said.

Putin said Russia would have to develop its own domestic technology and technology firms.

Finance minister Anton Siluanov said support for the Russian technology sector is a priority, but that every rouble of state support should be accompanied by at least three roubles of private investment.

The EU‚Äôs foreign ministers said on Monday that the sanctions imposed on Moscow are working, even though they also threatened the EU‚Äôs energy supplies.

Last week, Hungary‚Äôs nationalist premier Viktor Orban ‚Äì the EU leader closest to the Kremlin and a critic of Brussels ‚Äì denounced the policy, saying Brussels was hurting Europe more than Moscow.

‚ÄúSome European leaders have been saying that the sanctions were ‚Ä¶ a mistake,‚Äù EU policy chief Joseph Borrell told reporters as he arrived at the bloc‚Äôs headquarters on Monday for talks on closing loopholes in the sanctions regime and increasing pressure on Russia.

‚ÄúIt is what we had to do and we will continue doing,‚Äù he added.

Early reports of the attack gave varying accounts. The local police chief said there had been a single attacker, who had been arrested, while news agencies said three people were involved.

IRNA described them as ""takfiri terrorists"", a label used by officials in predominantly Shia Muslim Iran to refer to hard line, armed Sunni Islamist groups. Nournews, affiliated with Iran's top security body, said they were not Iranian nationals.

The attackers were in a car and shot at pilgrims and staff at the entrance to the shrine of Shah Cheragh, IRNA quoted witnesses as saying. Police arrested two of the three ""terrorists"" and were looking for the third.

The semi-official Tasnim news agency said several women and children were among the dead.

The attack took place on the same day that Iranian security forces opened fire at mourners who gathered in Amini's Kurdish home town of Saqez, according to a witness.

""Riot police shot mourners who gathered at the cemetery for Mahsa's memorial ceremony ‚Ä¶ dozens have been arrested,"" the witness said. Iranian authorities were not available to comment.

""The West is using [Ukrainian President Vladimir] Zelensky‚Äôs criminal Russophobic regime as one of the levers to contain our country.

""Our enemies do not hide their real aims: to destroy the Russian economy, undermine domestic political stability, defeat us on the battlefield, and ultimately significantly weaken or even destroy our centuries-old national statehood,"" Lavrov said.

20224,"Russia has reportedly picked up its first batch of Iranian-made combat drones that it intends to use on the battlefield during its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

U.S. officials say that Russian cargo planes departed Iran on Aug. 19 carrying at least two types of combat capable drones, the Washington Post reported Monday.

The Mohajer-6 and Shahed-series drones are believed to be the first of many shipments from Iran to Russia as part of the Kremlin‚Äôs plan to increase its attack drone capability in the war with Ukraine.

The deal between the two nations was reportedly negotiated over several months and included Iranian technical experts traveling to Russia to help set up systems as well as Russian military operatives traveling to Iran for training.

While the drones could provide Russia with a boost on the battlefield, U.S. officials reportedly said that Iranian drones have been the source of headaches and technical issues for the Russians.

""There are a few bugs in the system,"" an unnamed official told the Washington Post. ""The Russians are not satisfied.""

The Washington Post reported that Russia has 1,500 to 2,000 military surveillance drones as part of its Ukraine campaign but does not possess many combat capable drones. On the other side, Ukraine has been deploying Turkish-made combat drones that have been effective against Russian targets.

20231,"Iran has sent military personnel to Russian-occupied territory inside Crimea to train and advise the Russian military on the use of Iranian-built drones that Moscow has used to devastating effect in its war in Ukraine, according to two sources familiar with US intelligence.

Russia has launched many of what is believed to be a store of hundreds of Iranian-made drones from Crimea in a fusillade that has targeted Ukrainian cities and energy infrastructure in increasing numbers in recent weeks. The drones have been seen as a signal of growing closeness between Tehran and Moscow.

CNN has reached out to the Iranian mission at the United Nations for comment.

State Department principal deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said Tuesday that the ""deepening"" of relations between Moscow and Tehran should be seen as ""a profound threat.""

The Daily Mirror first reported the trainers' presence in Ukraine.

It was not immediately clear how many trainers traveled to Crimea and whether they remain present. One source briefed on US intelligence said ""dozens"" of Iranian personnel had been sent.

US officials have said that when Russia first began testing and deploying the drones in Ukraine in August, many of them experienced numerous failures. Russian operatives had been training on the systems inside Iran, but Iranian personnel began traveling to Crimea in recent weeks to help Russia operate the systems and try to fix their problems.

Tehran has provided two types: Shaheds, which explode on impact and have a range of upwards of 1,000 miles, and the Mohajer-6, which can both carry missiles and be used for surveillance.

US officials have seen Russia's reliance on these Iranian drones ‚Äî in particular the Shaheds ‚Äî as evidence that Russia is struggling to replenish its native stocks of munitions after eight months of missile salvos and a punishing regime of Western sanctions that the US believes has cut Moscow off from needed components for new weapons. Iran has denied sending the drones to Russia.

Patel said that the United States would ""continue to take practical, aggressive steps to make these weapons sales harder, including sanctions, export control actions against any entities involved.""

A US official told CNN that on Wednesday, the US, France and the United Kingdom plan to discuss Iran's drone transfers to Russia during a closed UN Security Council meeting.

The US, France, and the UK have said that the transfer of the Iranian-made drones to Russia violates UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which restricts certain arms transfers to or from Iran. It is unclear whether they will raise this specific point in the meeting Wednesday or move to snap back sanctions on Iran for the arms transfers.

Sergey Nechaev warned that the uncontrolled pumping German authorities should not have crossed the red line with arms supplies to Kiev, given the country's historical responsibility to the Russian people, Russian envoy to Germany Sergey Nechayev said in an interview with TASS.

""The German-made lethal weapons, supplied to the Kiev regime, are used not only against Russian servicemen, but also against civilians. It is certainly a red line that the German authorities should not have crossed, given Germany's historical responsibility to our people for Nazi crimes during the Great Patriotic War,"" the diplomat stressed. ""Not to mention our contribution to the postwar reunification of Germany,"" he added.

""And one should understand that this red line has always existed in Germany as well,"" Nechaev pointed out, recalling that for decades Berlin refrained from sending weapons, especially heavy military equipment, to armed conflict zones. ""There was a broad domestic political consensus on this. The practice has changed only now and only with regard to Russia,"" he stressed. ""It was a decision of the new coalition government of Germany, which we consider a serious mistake,"" the envoy said.

""Of course, such a turn could not help but have a most negative effect on our bilateral relations and the prospects for their development,"" he noted.

Nechaev warned that ""the uncontrolled pumping of Ukraine with weapons in violation of international arms trade and export control rules only leads to a prolongation of the conflict, new destruction, civilian casualties, and further destabilization of the situation in Europe, including Germany itself."" ""There is a real threat of Western weapons from Ukraine, including anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) and man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS), falling into the hands of terrorist groups and extremist organizations,"" he said. The Russian diplomat pointed out that ""the sale of lethal systems on the darknet is in full swing."" ""One would hope that common sense would prevail, but so far we only hear about plans for more and more German arms deliveries to Ukraine,"" Nechaev concluded.

20277,"The Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations has condemned the United States and Britain for keeping mute when it comes to cyberattacks against Iran.

The mission issued a statement on Thursday, ruling out the US-UK attempt to accuse the Islamic Republic of playing any kind of role in a cyberattack against Albania, explaining that Washington and London lack the legitimacy and competency to put forward such allegations against Iran.

The following is the statement:

‚ÄúAs a victim of cyber-attacks, Iran strongly condemns any cyber-attack targeting civilian infrastructure in all its forms & manifestations. We rejected the baseless accusations of the US and the UK against the Islamic Republic of Iran regarding an alleged cyberattack on Albania.

The US and the UK, that had previously remained silent in numerous cyberattacks against Iran‚Äôs infrastructures and its nuclear facilities, and had even directly or indirectly supported those measures, lack any legitimacy to level such accusations against Iran

As the main victim of terrorism, Iran urges the Member States of the UN to uphold their international obligations in combating terrorism by not harboring or supporting terrorist groups within their territory.

Iran, as a country that has been repeatedly attacked by cyberattacks, is an important part of responsible international efforts to deal with the threat of cyberattacks.‚Äù

According to IRNA, the US‚Äôs National Security Council spokesman Adrienne Watson claimed that Washington holds Iran accountable for the cyberattack that happened on July 15.

On Wednesday, Albanian Prime minister Edi Rama made some unfounded accusations against the Islamic Republic of Iran and issued a statement informing of severing ties with Iran.

Meanwhile, following the expulsion of an anti-Iran terrorist group dubbed MKO from Iraq, the terrorists were moved to Albania because the US wants to keep the group alive in order to use them in sabotage and spy operation against the Iranians.

The Islamic Republic's Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed regret for Albania's improper decision, while the European country is hosting a terrorist group named MKO, which shows Tirana is being affected by third parties.

The ministry ruled out the unproven claims against the Islamic Republic, underscoring that the roles played by third parties, who raised some allegations against Tehran, indicate that certain states sponsoring terrorism are behind sowing such kind of discord.

Foreign Ministry Spokesman Nasser Kanaani said on Thursday that some reports on improper manners of local authorities in Tirana in dealing with Iran's diplomats have caused concern among Iranian officials.

According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Islamic Republic as one of the countries that have been targeted in several cyberattacks dismisses any misuse of cyberspace as a tool to attack other countries‚Äô crucial infrastructure",09-09-2022 10:42,7,Ra Ju

Russia is buying millions of artillery shells and rockets from North Korea, according to newly declassified intelligence reports from the United States.

The New York Times, which first reported the purchases, said the reports provided little detail on the exact weaponry involved or the timing or size of the shipments.

Beyond short-range rockets and artillery shells, Russia was expected to try to buy additional North Korean equipment in future, the paper said, citing an unnamed US official.

Russia has deepened ties with countries including North Korea and Iran since its invasion of Ukraine in February drew international condemnation and sanctions that have made it more difficult to keep its military supplied with weapons and equipment.

The US has previously said that Moscow has been buying drones from Iran, which has not joined the condemnation of Russia, instead blaming NATO‚Äôs expansion in Eastern Europe as the root cause of the conflict.

Max Rose, former Biden administration adviser at the Pentagon, says he doesn't want to see Biden or Trump on 2024 ballot
New York Democratic congressional candidate Max Rose said Tuesday he does not support a 2024 presidential bid for Joe Biden.

""I do not think that Donald Trump should run 2024. I do not think that Joe Biden should run in 2024,"" Rose said in an interview with Fox 5 New York.

""I'm sick and tired of that generation being in power. We've got to move
The former congressman, who also served as the COVID-19 adviser to the Pentagon in 2021, made his comments after Biden reportedly told Al Sharpton he intended to take another stab at the presidency.

Biden has not officially announced his re-election bid and has dodged questions regarding a second term.

The president said it was ""much too early"" to decide on re-election when asked during in a ""60 Minutes"" interview in mid-September.

But, according to reports this week, the president told Sharpton of his plans in early September during a meeting at the White House with Black civil rights organizations.
While there is no other clear front-runner in the Democratic Party to take Biden‚Äôs place as a candidate, Rose said he believes it is time to move on.

""We have to turn the page, not just on this politics of ineffectiveness, but also these politics of division and vitriol,"" Rose said. ""It's time to move on as a nation.""",06-10-2022 00:39,6,News Politics US
20620,"Grassley, Johnson demand answers on why FBI paid Igor Danchenko as a source during Trump-Russia probe
Grassley and Johnson say the FBI paid Igor Danchenko despite the 'extensive derogatory information' attached to him
EXCLUSIVE: Republican senators are demanding answers on why the Russian national who served as the sub-source for the debunked anti-Trump dossier was hired by the FBI as a confidential human source and paid with U.S. taxpayer dollars throughout the bureau‚Äôs original investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election.

Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Ron Johnson, R-Wis., in a letter exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital and sent to Attorney General Merrick Garland, are seeking all FBI and Justice Department records related to government payments to Igor Danchenko, along with the counterintelligence concerns he posed and the bureau‚Äôs decision to rely on him as a source.

Danchenko served as the primary source for the salacious anti-Trump dossier authored by ex-British intelligence officer Christopher Steele. The dossier was commissioned by opposition research firm Fusion GPS and paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee through law firm Perkins Coie.
But the questions from Grassley and Johnson come after Special Counsel John Durham, in a filing unsealed earlier this month, revealed that the FBI paid Danchenko to be a confidential human source for the FBI from January 2017 through October 2020.

Durham charged Danchenko last year with five counts of making false statements to the FBI. The charges stem from statements Danchenko made relating to the sources he used in providing information to an investigative firm in the United Kingdom.
Despite the FBI paying Danchenko to serve as a confidential human source during the Trump administration‚Äîand during Special Counsel Robert Mueller‚Äôs investigation into whether members of the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election‚ÄîDanchenko was the subject of an FBI counterintelligence investigation from 2009 to 2011.

That FBI investigation into Danchenko focused on his contacts with suspected Russian intelligence officers and reported attempts to facilitate payments for classified information.

""The FBI, even in light of the extensive derogatory information attached to Danchenko, proceeded to pay him as a confidential human source three months later from March 2017 to October 2020 as part of Crossfire Hurricane,"" Grassley and Johnson wrote to Garland. ""Therefore, while we were investigating the Justice Department‚Äôs and FBI‚Äôs misconduct with respect to Crossfire Hurricane, you maintained him on the government‚Äôs payroll.""
They added: ""This extraordinary fact pattern requires additional information from the Justice Department and FBI relating to why Danchenko was placed on the payroll and paid by the taxpayer to assist in the federal government‚Äôs flawed investigation into President Trump.""

Grassley and Johnson demanded all records related to government payments made to Danchenko, the counterintelligence investigation into him, and his later hiring by the FBI by Oct. 22.

DOJ did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment on the letter.
Meanwhile, the Justice Department's inspector general in 2019 revealed that the dossier helped serve as the basis for warrants obtained against former Trump campaign aide Carter Page.
The Justice Department admitted in 2020 that the FISA warrants to surveil Page, when stripped of the FBI's misinformation, did not meet the necessary legal threshold and never should have been issued.
Durham has indicted three people as part of his investigation: Danchenko in November 2021, Michael Sussmann in September 2021, and Kevin Clinesmith in August 2020.

Sussmann was found not guilty in June. Clinesmith pleaded guilty to altering an email about Carter Page to say that he was ""not a source"" for another government agency, even though Page has said he was a source for the CIA.
The Justice Department relied on Clinesmith‚Äôs assertion as it submitted its third and final renewal application in 2017 to eavesdrop on Page under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Clinesmith pleaded guilty and in 2021 was sentenced to 12 months probation and 400 hours of community service.

Sources have told Fox News that Durham‚Äôs investigation is ongoing.",26-09-2022 23:56,20,News Politics US

Biden is speaking to the United Nations General Assembly in New York City Wednesday
President Biden accused Russia of an ""extremely significant"" violation of the United Nations international charter in its ""brutal, needless war"" against Ukraine, delivering harsh words directed to Russian president Vladimir Putin, saying the war was ""chosen by one man.""

Biden, speaking to the United Nations General Assembly in New York City Wednesday, reflected on the past year.

""In the last year, our world has experienced great upheaval‚Äî growing crisis and food insecurity; record heat, floods, droughts, COVID-19, inflation, and a brutal, needless war‚Äîa war chosen by one man,"" Biden said in his first words to UNGA.
""To be very blunt, let us speak plainly. A permanent member of the United Nations Security Council invaded its neighbor, attempted to erase a sovereign state from the map,"" Biden said. ""Russia has shamelessly violated the core tenets of the United Nations Charter‚Äîno more important than the clear prohibition against countries taking the territory of their neighbor by force.""

Biden, speaking of Putin by name, said the Russian president has made ""overt nuclear threats against Europe and a reckless disregard for the responsibilities of the nonproliferation regime.""

""Now, Russia is calling more soldiers to join the fight and the Kremlin is organizing a sham referendum to try to annex parts of Ukraine‚Äîan extremely significant violation of the U.N. charter,"" Biden said, urging the world to ""see these outrageous acts for what they are.""
""Putin claims he had to act because Russia was threatened,"" Biden said. ""But no one threatened Russia‚Äîno one other than Russia sought conflict. In fact, we warned it was coming.""
He added: ""And, with many of you, we worked to try to avert Putin‚Äôs own words, make his true purpose unmistakable just before he invaded.""

Biden said that the war has provided ""horrifying evidence of Russia‚Äôs atrocities and war crimes,"" pointing to the discovery of mass graves in Ukraine filled with bodies ""showing signs of torture.""
""This war is about extinguishing Ukraine‚Äôs right to exist as a state‚Äîplain and simple‚Äîand Ukraine‚Äôs right to exist as a people,"" Biden said. ""Whoever you are, wherever you live, whatever you believe that should not, that should make your blood run cold.""",21-09-2022 21:11,9,News Politics US
20626,"Biden to meet in person with Ron DeSantis to survey Hurricane Ian destruction
Biden and DeSantis went to war with each other over bussing migrants to Martha's Vineyard last month
President Biden will meet with Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in person to coordinate efforts to rebuild after Hurricane Ian, the White House announced Tuesday.

White House Press Secretary Karin Jean-Pierre confirmed the meeting during a Tuesday press briefing, saying DeSantis will offer an update on recovery efforts alongside FEMA director Deanne Criswell. It will be the first time Biden and DeSantis have met face-to-face since their battle of words over the bussing of illegal immigrants to Democratic strongholds in September.

""Tomorrow President Biden and the First Lady will travel to Fort Myers Florida to reaffirm his commitment to supporting the people of Florida as they recover and rebuild from the devastating storm,"" Jean-Pierre said. ""While there, the president will meet with small business owners and local residents impacted by Hurricane Ian and thank the federal, state, and local officials working around the clock to provide life-saving assistance.""

""Governor DeSantis, the FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell and other state and local officials will also provide the president with an operational briefing on the current response and recovery efforts,"" she added.
Hurricane Ian comes not long after Biden condemned DeSantis for sending two flights of illegal migrants to Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts earlier in September.

The president accused DeSantis of ""playing politics"" and using illegal aliens as political ""props"" last month.

""Republicans are playing politics with human beings, using them as props. What they‚Äôre doing is simply wrong, it‚Äôs un-American, it‚Äôs reckless,"" Biden said Sept. 16.
DeSantis ripped into his critics at the time, however, pointing out that the Biden administration had already been flying migrants across the country before he took action.
""So, when Biden is flying these people all over the fruited plain in the middle of the night, I didn't hear a peep out of those people,"" DeSantis said during a rally. ""I haven't heard a peep about all the people that have been told by Biden [that migrants] can just come in ‚Äî and they're going, they're being abused by the cartels. They're drowning in the Rio Grande. You had 50 that died in some shed in Texas. I heard no outrage about any of that.""

Biden initially appeared hesitant to call DeSantis prior to Hurricane Ian's landfall, but he ultimately made the call a day before the storm struck.",05-10-2022 00:38,5,News Politics US

Greetings to all.
First of all, thoughts about Amina's family, her husband.
All relatives and friends.
Brothers in arms.
You always want to hope that Amina did not die!

Russia wants a world without education and without culture.
But you know these words:
where there is no culture, there are no people. There is no soul!
Culture is the evolution and mirror of the nation. It's up to you to decide what your nations are like, which artists represent your country.
Russia has been showing us its ""culture"" for 8 years. Unfortunately, we see what this country and its people want.
They brutally murdered a woman What kind of creature is this that kills a woman just because she was defending her land? And they don‚Äôt even have the ""courage"" to do it themselves. But give the order to do it with special cruelty.
Women- they are to be loved, not to be killed.
Sometimes I feel alone in the midst of this. I don't understand how the world allows Russia to do all this.
I saw it long before Ukraine!
Europeans do not understand that they have been cut off from their own emotions.
I've been wanting to dedicate a song to Amina for several years now, but I actually hesitated because I really have a lot of respect for her. Well, it is done.

20631,"Beto O'Rourke says Biden admin 'certainly' needs 'to do more' to find solutions on border crisis
Texas gubernatorial candidate Beto O'Rourke said 'stunts' like bussing and border wall are not the right solutions for border crisis
Texas' Democratic gubernatorial nominee Beto O'Rourke on Sunday said the Biden administration ""certainly"" needs ""to do more"" to help with the border crisis on the U.S.-Mexico border while dismissing Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's ""stunts"" of sending buses of migrants to Democratic-run cities and a border wall as solutions he supports.

""We need more judges. We need more administrators,"" O'Rourke said. ""We need more help and certainly the Biden administration does need to do more, but the governor of the state of Texas could work with our federal partners to make sure that we have these solutions.""

""And again, allows us to live up to our values, reduces some of that chaos that we see in places like Del Rio and Eagle Pass, and ensures that we know who is coming into this country. We're going to be so much stronger, safer, and more successful if we focus on solutions at the border,"" O'Rourke added during an interview on MSNBC's ""The Sunday Show.""

O'Rourke said that he doesn't believe that ""stunts"" like bussing and putting up a border wall are the right solutions for problems on the U.S.-Mexico border and instead said he believes that there needs to be something done to reduce the length of time that asylum seekers have to wait for their cases to be adjudicated.
O'Rourke said he would like to see cases be adjudicated between six weeks and six months versus six years and said he understands why asylum seekers don't want to wait several years and will sometimes leave the facilities to try to cross ports of entry, but claimed he doesn't condone it.

During Friday's debate between Abbott and O'Rourke, they sparred over the border crisis and what the solutions should be for tackling the influx of migrants that continue to spiral out of control on the southern border.

""Under the Biden administration, we have more people coming across the border than ever in the history of our country,"" Abbott said.

""Texas has responded by making sure that we have the National Guard and DPS deployed where they are making arrests and turning people back, illegal immigrants, as well as what we‚Äôre doing by bussing people from where border security has dropped them off to sanctuary cities in the Northeastern part of the country,"" he added.
O'Rourke argued Abbott is in the eighth year of his administration and that his ""Operation Lone Star"" program is ""seeing not fewer but more encounters at our border right now.""

""What we need is a safe, legal, orderly path for anyone who wants to work, to join family or to seek asylum,"" O'Rourke said. ""If you come to this country we expect you to follow the law. But on our side we expect our laws to reflect our values.""
O'Rourke also said no more money should be allocated to Abbott's ""failed"" program called ""Operation Lone Star"" and said it was ""political theater.""

Abbott vowed that there will be more cities in the future receiving buses from Texas, saying, ""We will continue to have to move migrants because Joe Biden continues to allow more illegal immigrants to come into the state of Texas.""",03-10-2022 00:18,34,News Politics US

Rep. Scalise says voters across US are 'furious' over Biden's 'far-left, socialist agenda'
U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise blasted Democrats on Sunday after he said Senior White House economic adviser Jared Bernstein was ""bragging"" about gas prices being lower today while the cost of fuel remains higher than when President Biden first took office last year.

Scalise, R-La., appeared on ""Fox News Sunday"" to discuss how he believes Republicans will flip seats from the Democrats in November‚Äôs midterm elections.

""[Voters] are furious with Biden and Pelosi‚Äôs far-left socialist agenda that‚Äôs led to increased spending, increased inflation, just the cost of everything when you go to the grocery store,"" the House Minority Whip said, adding ""if you can even afford to put gas in your car when you get there.""
""The White House and Jared Bernstein just before me, they‚Äôre talking, bragging as if gas prices are lower,"" Scalise continued. ""Gas prices are about 60% higher today than when Joe Biden took office.""
When Biden first took office in January 2021, the national average for regular gas was $2.39 per gallon, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

On Sunday, AAA reported that the national average price for regular gas was $3.888 per gallon. That was a slight decrease from Saturday‚Äôs national average of $3.892 per gallon.
""Biden‚Äôs begged Russia, he‚Äôs begged Iran, Venezuela and other countries to produce oil when we should be producing it in America,"" he said.

The highest recorded average price per gallon for regular was $5.016 on June 14.

Scalise also slammed Biden for shutting down American energy production, saying that the decision has contributed to the increase in fuel prices.
Scalise said that America‚Äôs oil production is much cleaner than that of other countries, noting that if we were to produce oil ourselves, it would bring prices down",17-10-2022 01:47,43,News Politics US

20676,"Trump Mar-a-Lago case latest to land on Supreme Court‚Äôs ‚Äòshadow docket‚Äô
Justice Samuel Alito says the emergency docket has been labeled with 'sinister term' in an attempt to undermine the Supreme Court
The Supreme Court is expected this week to make a ruling on whether the government can start to review the documents seized from former President Trump‚Äôs home in its criminal investigation, a case it agreed to take under its so-called ""shadow docket.""

Trump filed an emergency petition last week asking the Supreme Court to review an Appeals Court decision that said the Department of Justice can keep reviewing documents it seized at his home in August. If the Supreme Court agrees, an independent special master, former District Judge Raymond Dearie, would review the seized documents and decide which might be privileged and therefore protected from the government‚Äôs review.

The Trump case is just one of many emergency petitions the Supreme Court will handle that will fill out what has come to be known as it‚Äôs ""shadow docket."" Unlike the regular caseload that makes its way through the court system and is subject to extensive briefings and oral argument before the justices, the shadow docket is a more unpredictable set of decisions that stem from emergency petitions like the one Trump filed.
Shadow docket cases are more time-sensitive and arise when a procedural issue needs to be addressed before the Supreme Court has time to hear all the arguments on the merits. Several criteria must be met before the Court adds a new case to its emergency docket, including whether inaction will cause irreparable harm or when there is a ""reasonable probability"" that four justices will eventually agree to review the merits.
One notable shadow docket case was decided in April, when the Court voted 5-4 to block a lower court ruling that would have gutted a business-friendly environmental rule written under the Trump administration.

Additionally, in a shadow docket case that helped Democrats, the Court in March blocked a lower court ruling that said the Pentagon could not condition the deployment of Navy SEALS on their vaccination status.

The Court‚Äôs shadow docket cases have drawn complaints, including from the justices themselves. In the April environmental case that supported the Trump-era regulation, Justice Elena Kagan argued that taking up that case ""renders the Court‚Äôs emergency docket not for emergencies at all.""
""[T]he majority‚Äôs decision is emblematic of too much of this Court‚Äôs shadow-docket decision making‚Äîwhich every day becomes more un-reasoned, inconsistent, and impossible to defend,"" she wrote.
However, Justice Samuel Alito rebutted his colleague in a September 2021 speech at Notre Dame, concluding that there is nothing all that shadowy about the Court's emergency docket.
""The catchy and sinister term ‚Äòshadow docket‚Äô has been used to portray the court as having been captured by a dangerous cabal that resorts to sneaky and improper methods to get its ways‚Ä¶ This portrayal feeds unprecedented efforts to intimidate the court or damage it as an independent institution,"" he said.
Emergency applications to the Supreme Court are sent to the individual Justice assigned to the relevant circuit out of the 13 federal circuits. Trump‚Äôs emergency application, which could be decided this week, was sent to Justice Clarence Thomas because he covers the 11th circuit, which includes cases in the state of Florida.",10-10-2022 22:04,10,News Politics US

20700,"Cheney-backed election reform bill strips VP of all authority when counting presidential votes
The bill is an attempt to close down the opportunity for any party or presidential candidate to create uncertainty about the results of the election
Reps. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., and Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., introduced legislation on Monday clarifying that the vice president has no authority to interfere with the counting of electoral votes in presidential elections.

The Presidential Election Reform Act is the culmination of the two lawmakers‚Äô work on the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. Cheney is one of just two Democrats on the committee, which has spent the last year investigating what they describe as an attempted coup to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

Cheney and Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., have supported Democratic conclusions that the demonstrators who appeared at the Capitol on January 6 were directed by former President Donald Trump, and that Trump pressured his vice president, Mike Pence, to refuse to count the electoral votes from certain states in his role as presiding officer during the joint session of Congress where votes are counted.

Over the weekend, Cheney and Lofgren wrote an op-ed that said Trump continues to make ""intentionally false election-fraud allegations,"" which raises the prospect of ""another effort to steal a presidential election.""

Their bill, which is likely to get a vote in the House this week, is an attempt to close down the opportunity for any party or presidential candidate to create uncertainty about the results of the election. One way it does that is by clarifying that the vice president is only there to preside over the counting of votes.

""The role of the presiding officer is ministerial,"" the bill says. It adds that the vice president ""shall not have any power to determine or otherwise resolve disputes concerning the proper list of electors for a State, the validity of electors for a State, or the votes of electors of a State.""

""[T]he presiding officer shall not order any delay in counting or president over any period of delay in counting electoral votes,"" the bill adds.
The proposal makes it much more difficult for members of Congress to object to the electoral vote count of any state. Today, only one member of the House and Senate is needed to object, which can prompt lengthy debates and votes over that objection.

But the Cheney-Lofgren bill would require a third of all members of both the House and Senate to raise an objection, creating a very high hurdle for interruptions of the count.

The bill also creates new requirements for governors of each state to transmit their presidential election results to Washington. It would require governors to certify results no later than Dec. 14, and those results must be sent to the archivist of the United States.
Governors who fail to accomplish this can face lawsuits from presidential candidates. But as Cheney and Lofgren noted in their op-ed, these challenges would take place before Congress meets on Jan. 6 to count the votes. They said this should help ensure that ""Congress‚Äôs proceeding on Jan. 6 is purely ministerial.""
The bill also writes into federal law that states can delay their presidential elections for up to five days if a catastrophic event happens that dramatically complicates the voting process. Along these lines, it gives presidential candidates the ability to petition the court for a delay in these cases.The bill is likely to pass the House this week thanks to support from Democrats who continue to warn against Trump‚Äôs influence in the Republican Party. Many Republicans, meanwhile, are likely to oppose it as the product of a committee on which they weren‚Äôt allowed to participate with the members of their choice. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected two GOP picks to serve on the Jan. 6 Committee, and in response, GOP leadership boycotted it.

Evidence of GOP anger over the committee could also be seen in Cheney's primary defeat in Wyoming in August.",20-09-2022 01:44,14,News Politics US

20778,"Mar-a-Lago probe: Supreme Court denies Trump appeal for special master to review classified records
Trump's team requested Supreme Court intervene to allow special master to review classified records seized from Mar-a-Lago
The Supreme Court has denied former President Donald Trump‚Äôs motion to allow Special Master Raymond Dearie access to review the approximately 100 classified documents seized by the FBI in its raid of Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.

In a brief order, the Supreme Court ruled: ""The application to vacate the stay entered by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit on September 21, 2022, presented to Justice Thomas and by him referred to the Court is denied.""

Trump's attorneys last week elevated the former president's legal battle to the Supreme Court, requesting that Justice Clarence Thomas, who has jurisdiction over the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, vacate the stay by a lower court that allowed the DOJ to review classified records taken in August from Mar-a-Lago instead of court-appointed Special Master Raymond Dearie.
U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon issued an injunction against the DOJ's use of the 100 documents purportedly marked as classified to be used for investigative purposes.

The 11th Circuit overturned Cannon's order and prevented Dearie from reviewing those materials. The panel had limited Dearie's review to only the non-classified documents seized from Mar-a-Lago.

The Supreme Court‚Äôs order comes after the Justice Department this week asked that the high court deny Trump‚Äôs request to block the DOJ from continuing its review of classified documents seized from Mar-a-Lago in August.

Trump‚Äôs legal team had asked the Supreme Court to intervene, but the Justice Department in a filing on Tuesday argued that the court of appeals ""correctly held that it had appellate jurisdiction to review and stay the portion of the September 5 order that requires the government to turn over the documents bearing classification markings for special-master review.""

The Justice Department argued that even if there were ""some doubt on that score,"" Trump ""certainly cannot establish the clear error required to justify the relief he seeks ‚Äî particularly because he does not acknowledge, much less attempt to rebut, the court of appeals‚Äô conclusion that the district court‚Äôs order was a serious and unwarranted intrusion on the Executive Branch‚Äôs authority to control the use and distribution of extraordinarily sensitive government records.""
""The application should be denied,"" the Justice Department said in its filing.

But Trump's legal team, in their initial filing to the Supreme Court, argued that ""the unprecedented circumstances presented by this case‚Äîan investigation of the Forty-Fifth President of the United States by the administration of his political rival and successor‚Äîcompelled the District Court to acknowledge the significant need for enhanced vigilance and to order the appointment of a Special Master to ensure fairness, transparency, and maintenance of the public trust.""

The Justice Department last month, in its 11th Circuit filing, is working to appeal Cannon's decision to appoint a special master altogether, arguing that it is unable to examine records taken from Trump's Florida estate that may constitute as evidence of crimes.
""The government is thus unable to examine records that were commingled with materials bearing classification markings, including records that may shed light on, for example, how the materials bearing classification markings were transferred to Plaintiff‚Äôs residence, how they were stored, and who may have accessed them,"" DOJ officials wrote in the appeal. ""The records not marked as classified may also constitute evidence of potential violations ‚Ä¶""

DOJ officials also stated in the filing that an expedited appeal ""if successful"" would allow the government to ""more quickly resume its full investigation without restraints on its review and use of evidence seized pursuant to a lawful search warrant.""",14-10-2022 01:37,16,News Politics US

20801,"Trump to be deposed in E. Jean Carroll defamation lawsuit after federal judge rejected request for delay
Former President Trump's deposition is set to take place on October 19
A federal judge ordered that former President Trump sit for a deposition in the defamation lawsuit filed by writer E. Jean Carroll, who claimed he raped her in the 1990s and damaged her reputation in 2019 when he denied the allegations.

U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan rejected a request by Trump's legal team that his testimony be delayed. His deposition is scheduled for October 19.

""The defendant should not be permitted to run the clock out on plaintiff‚Äôs attempt to gain a remedy for what allegedly was a serious wrong,"" Kaplan wrote in a filing Wednesday.
The decision comes in a lawsuit brought by Carroll, who is known for her ""Ask E. Jean"" column that ran in Elle Magazine. Carroll alleges that Trump raped her in a dressing room at Bergdorf Goodman, a department store in New York City.

Carroll claims that Trump damaged her reputation in 2019 when he denied raping herTrump has repeatedly denied the allegations.

""We look forward to establishing on the record that this case is, and always has been, entirely without merit,"" Trump lawyer Alina Habba told Fox News Wednesday.
Carroll is set to be deposed on Friday.
""We are pleased that Judge Kaplan agreed with our position not to stay discovery in this case,"" Carroll's attorney Robbie Kaplan said. ""We look forward to filing our case under the Adult Survivors Act and moving forward to trial with all dispatch.""

Separately, Trump appeared for a deposition in August as part of New York Attorney General Letitia James‚Äô civil investigation. Trump invoked his Fifth Amendment rights, per the advice of his attorneys, during his deposition.",13-10-2022 00:12,31,News Politics US

21027,"Putin says West cannot isolate Russia or send it back in time

Russian President Vladimir Putin says it is impossible to cut Russia off from the rest of the world, and that sanctions imposed by Western countries will not turn the clock back on Russia‚Äôs development.

Since sending troops into Ukraine on February 24, Russia has been hit with a barrage of Western sanctions designed to isolate it from the global economy that have deprived it of access to goods including commercial electronics, semiconductors and aircraft parts.

‚ÄúNot just restrictions but the almost-complete closure of access to foreign hi-tech products is being deliberately, intentionally used against our country,‚Äù Putin said on Monday, speaking at a video conference with government figures.

‚ÄúIt is clear that this is a huge challenge for our country, but ‚Ä¶ we are not going to give up and stay in a state of disarray or, as some of our ‚Äòwell-wishers‚Äô predict, go back decades. Of course not,‚Äù he said.

Putin said Russia would have to develop its own domestic technology and technology firms.

Finance minister Anton Siluanov said support for the Russian technology sector is a priority, but that every rouble of state support should be accompanied by at least three roubles of private investment.

The EU‚Äôs foreign ministers said on Monday that the sanctions imposed on Moscow are working, even though they also threatened the EU‚Äôs energy supplies.

Last week, Hungary‚Äôs nationalist premier Viktor Orban ‚Äì the EU leader closest to the Kremlin and a critic of Brussels ‚Äì denounced the policy, saying Brussels was hurting Europe more than Moscow.

‚ÄúSome European leaders have been saying that the sanctions were ‚Ä¶ a mistake,‚Äù EU policy chief Joseph Borrell told reporters as he arrived at the bloc‚Äôs headquarters on Monday for talks on closing loopholes in the sanctions regime and increasing pressure on Russia.

‚ÄúIt is what we had to do and we will continue doing,‚Äù he added.

Early reports of the attack gave varying accounts. The local police chief said there had been a single attacker, who had been arrested, while news agencies said three people were involved.

IRNA described them as ""takfiri terrorists"", a label used by officials in predominantly Shia Muslim Iran to refer to hard line, armed Sunni Islamist groups. Nournews, affiliated with Iran's top security body, said they were not Iranian nationals.

The attackers were in a car and shot at pilgrims and staff at the entrance to the shrine of Shah Cheragh, IRNA quoted witnesses as saying. Police arrested two of the three ""terrorists"" and were looking for the third.

The semi-official Tasnim news agency said several women and children were among the dead.

The attack took place on the same day that Iranian security forces opened fire at mourners who gathered in Amini's Kurdish home town of Saqez, according to a witness.

""Riot police shot mourners who gathered at the cemetery for Mahsa's memorial ceremony ‚Ä¶ dozens have been arrested,"" the witness said. Iranian authorities were not available to comment.

Iran's semi-official ISNA news agency said about 10,000 people had gathered at the cemetery, adding that the internet was cut off after clashes between security forces and people there.",27-10-2022 09:57,11,Ra Ju

""The West is using [Ukrainian President Vladimir] Zelensky‚Äôs criminal Russophobic regime as one of the levers to contain our country. We see Washington and its NATO allies increasing the supplies of lethal weapons to the Ukrainian neo-Nazis, sharing intelligence data with them and recruiting foreign mercenaries to send to Ukraine. All this, in one way or another, makes them parties to the conflict,"" Lavrov‚Äôs address reads.

He stressed that the US-led collective West, ""obsessed with world domination,"" has unleashed a ""total hybrid war"" against Russia.

""Our enemies do not hide their real aims: to destroy the Russian economy, undermine domestic political stability, defeat us on the battlefield, and ultimately significantly weaken or even destroy our centuries-old national statehood,"" Lavrov said.

This is the reason, he said, why the ideologists of ""cancel culture rule the roost in the West with respect to Russia.""

""All restrictions on any actions against us have been lifted. The haters of the multi-ethnic Russian people feel they are free to take any liberty,"" Lavrov explained.

21044,"Russia has reportedly picked up its first batch of Iranian-made combat drones that it intends to use on the battlefield during its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

U.S. officials say that Russian cargo planes departed Iran on Aug. 19 carrying at least two types of combat capable drones, the Washington Post reported Monday.

The Mohajer-6 and Shahed-series drones are believed to be the first of many shipments from Iran to Russia as part of the Kremlin‚Äôs plan to increase its attack drone capability in the war with Ukraine.

The deal between the two nations was reportedly negotiated over several months and included Iranian technical experts traveling to Russia to help set up systems as well as Russian military operatives traveling to Iran for training.

While the drones could provide Russia with a boost on the battlefield, U.S. officials reportedly said that Iranian drones have been the source of headaches and technical issues for the Russians.

""There are a few bugs in the system,"" an unnamed official told the Washington Post. ""The Russians are not satisfied.""

The Washington Post reported that Russia has 1,500 to 2,000 military surveillance drones as part of its Ukraine campaign but does not possess many combat capable drones. On the other side, Ukraine has been deploying Turkish-made combat drones that have been effective against Russian targets.

21051,"Iran has sent military personnel to Russian-occupied territory inside Crimea to train and advise the Russian military on the use of Iranian-built drones that Moscow has used to devastating effect in its war in Ukraine, according to two sources familiar with US intelligence.

Russia has launched many of what is believed to be a store of hundreds of Iranian-made drones from Crimea in a fusillade that has targeted Ukrainian cities and energy infrastructure in increasing numbers in recent weeks. The drones have been seen as a signal of growing closeness between Tehran and Moscow.

CNN has reached out to the Iranian mission at the United Nations for comment.

State Department principal deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said Tuesday that the ""deepening"" of relations between Moscow and Tehran should be seen as ""a profound threat.""

The Daily Mirror first reported the trainers' presence in Ukraine.

It was not immediately clear how many trainers traveled to Crimea and whether they remain present. One source briefed on US intelligence said ""dozens"" of Iranian personnel had been sent.

US officials have said that when Russia first began testing and deploying the drones in Ukraine in August, many of them experienced numerous failures. Russian operatives had been training on the systems inside Iran, but Iranian personnel began traveling to Crimea in recent weeks to help Russia operate the systems and try to fix their problems.

Tehran has provided two types: Shaheds, which explode on impact and have a range of upwards of 1,000 miles, and the Mohajer-6, which can both carry missiles and be used for surveillance.

US officials have seen Russia's reliance on these Iranian drones ‚Äî in particular the Shaheds ‚Äî as evidence that Russia is struggling to replenish its native stocks of munitions after eight months of missile salvos and a punishing regime of Western sanctions that the US believes has cut Moscow off from needed components for new weapons. Iran has denied sending the drones to Russia.

Patel said that the United States would ""continue to take practical, aggressive steps to make these weapons sales harder, including sanctions, export control actions against any entities involved.""

A US official told CNN that on Wednesday, the US, France and the United Kingdom plan to discuss Iran's drone transfers to Russia during a closed UN Security Council meeting.

The US, France, and the UK have said that the transfer of the Iranian-made drones to Russia violates UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which restricts certain arms transfers to or from Iran. It is unclear whether they will raise this specific point in the meeting Wednesday or move to snap back sanctions on Iran for the arms transfers.

Sergey Nechaev warned that the uncontrolled pumping German authorities should not have crossed the red line with arms supplies to Kiev, given the country's historical responsibility to the Russian people, Russian envoy to Germany Sergey Nechayev said in an interview with TASS.

""The German-made lethal weapons, supplied to the Kiev regime, are used not only against Russian servicemen, but also against civilians. It is certainly a red line that the German authorities should not have crossed, given Germany's historical responsibility to our people for Nazi crimes during the Great Patriotic War,"" the diplomat stressed. ""Not to mention our contribution to the postwar reunification of Germany,"" he added.

""And one should understand that this red line has always existed in Germany as well,"" Nechaev pointed out, recalling that for decades Berlin refrained from sending weapons, especially heavy military equipment, to armed conflict zones. ""There was a broad domestic political consensus on this. The practice has changed only now and only with regard to Russia,"" he stressed. ""It was a decision of the new coalition government of Germany, which we consider a serious mistake,"" the envoy said.

""Of course, such a turn could not help but have a most negative effect on our bilateral relations and the prospects for their development,"" he noted.

Nechaev warned that ""the uncontrolled pumping of Ukraine with weapons in violation of international arms trade and export control rules only leads to a prolongation of the conflict, new destruction, civilian casualties, and further destabilization of the situation in Europe, including Germany itself."" ""There is a real threat of Western weapons from Ukraine, including anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) and man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS), falling into the hands of terrorist groups and extremist organizations,"" he said. The Russian diplomat pointed out that ""the sale of lethal systems on the darknet is in full swing."" ""One would hope that common sense would prevail, but so far we only hear about plans for more and more German arms deliveries to Ukraine,"" Nechaev concluded.

The White House announces a new military aid package to Ukraine, which includes anti-artillery radars, armored vehicles, anti-drone systems, and demining equipment.

Yesterday, Thursday, the White House announced the approval of granting Ukraine an additional $600 million in military aid, including primarily HIMARS missiles, which Washington had previously provided to Ukrainian forces, but which do not include long-range missiles that Kyiv continues to demand.

The US presidency said, in a statement, that ""this assistance includes equipment and services, in addition to military training,"" without additional details, especially about the weapons it contains.

The following is the statement:

‚ÄúAs a victim of cyber-attacks, Iran strongly condemns any cyber-attack targeting civilian infrastructure in all its forms & manifestations. We rejected the baseless accusations of the US and the UK against the Islamic Republic of Iran regarding an alleged cyberattack on Albania.

The US and the UK, that had previously remained silent in numerous cyberattacks against Iran‚Äôs infrastructures and its nuclear facilities, and had even directly or indirectly supported those measures, lack any legitimacy to level such accusations against Iran

As the main victim of terrorism, Iran urges the Member States of the UN to uphold their international obligations in combating terrorism by not harboring or supporting terrorist groups within their territory.

Iran, as a country that has been repeatedly attacked by cyberattacks, is an important part of responsible international efforts to deal with the threat of cyberattacks.‚Äù

On Wednesday, Albanian Prime minister Edi Rama made some unfounded accusations against the Islamic Republic of Iran and issued a statement informing of severing ties with Iran.

Meanwhile, following the expulsion of an anti-Iran terrorist group dubbed MKO from Iraq, the terrorists were moved to Albania because the US wants to keep the group alive in order to use them in sabotage and spy operation against the Iranians.

Foreign Ministry Spokesman Nasser Kanaani said on Thursday that some reports on improper manners of local authorities in Tirana in dealing with Iran's diplomats have caused concern among Iranian officials.

Russia is buying millions of artillery shells and rockets from North Korea, according to newly declassified intelligence reports from the United States.

The New York Times, which first reported the purchases, said the reports provided little detail on the exact weaponry involved or the timing or size of the shipments.

Beyond short-range rockets and artillery shells, Russia was expected to try to buy additional North Korean equipment in future, the paper said, citing an unnamed US official.

Russia‚Äôs move to buy weaponry from North Korea, an isolated state subject to international sanctions over its nuclear weapons programme, demonstrates that ‚Äúthe Russian military continues to suffer from severe supply shortages in Ukraine, due in part to export controls and sanctions,‚Äù the Associated Press news agency reported, citing a US official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Russia has deepened ties with countries including North Korea and Iran since its invasion of Ukraine in February drew international condemnation and sanctions that have made it more difficult to keep its military supplied with weapons and equipment.

The US has previously said that Moscow has been buying drones from Iran, which has not joined the condemnation of Russia, instead blaming NATO‚Äôs expansion in Eastern Europe as the root cause of the conflict.

Scientists first began working on such solutions nearly 100 years ago.

Chinese professor Ji Wanfeng says the new drone will make it possible to disrupt the defense systems of enemy aircraft carriers simply and quickly. The drone can dive underwater to avoid radar. When detected by sonar, the drone dives out and rises into the air. According to the professor, the simultaneous use of several such drones could overwhelm the computer systems of aircraft carriers.

The flying submarine, as strange as such a designation may sound, is equipped with a cushion at the bottom. By filling it, you can control the dive level of the drone. After surfacing, there may be problems with takeoff. The Chinese specialists were able to solve this problem by creating an advanced control system by which the drone glides on the waves before takeoff.

The fuel ship, Lady Sarah, was seized on Wednesday while carrying 8,230 tons of gas, Yemen‚Äôs Arabic-language al-Masirah television website reported, citing a statement by the YGC.

The latest seizure has ‚Äúbrought the number of the Yemen-bound fuel ships confiscated to three,‚Äù the statement added, but did not mention the exact time frame.

The statement said that the Lady Sarah, like other fuel ships confiscated by Saudi forces, had been inspected and obtained United Nations clearance to enter Yemen.

Meanwhile, Mohammed Abdulsalam, the chief negotiator of Yemen‚Äôs National Salvation Government, said that the Saudi-led coalition is not maintaining the truce properly and is instead ‚Äúkilling time which is not accepted by our nation.‚Äù

Over the past one and a half years, the Saudi-led coalition has held dozens of ships, blocking Yemen‚Äôs much-needed fuel imports amid a crippling siege.

The act of maritime piracy has deteriorated the humanitarian situation in Yemen, while a significant part of the country‚Äôs vital sectors, including hospitals as well as electricity and water services, has already come to a halt.

Saudi Arabia launched the devastating war against Yemen in March 2015 in collaboration with a number of its allies and with arms and logistics support from the US and several Western states.

It aimed to return to power the former Riyadh-backed regime and crush the popular Ansarullah resistance movement, which has been running state affairs in the absence of an effective government in Yemen.

Despite killing tens of thousands of Yemenis and turning entire Yemen into the scene of the world‚Äôs worst humanitarian crisis, the Saudi-led coalition failed to fulfill its goals.

Yemen‚Äôs initial two-month UN-backed truce started at the beginning of the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan on April 2 and was extended for another 2-month on June 2.

In line with the agreement, the coalition agreed to end its attacks on Yemeni soil and end a simultaneous siege that it has been enforcing against Yemen.

However, it has violated the truce on several occasions by attacking the war-battered country, canceling flights, and confiscating fuel ships, to name a few.

Figures announced by Yemen‚Äôs Ministry of Public Health and Population show that by June 30, since the beginning of the ceasefire, some 387 civilians have been either killed or injured in Saudi-led coalition attacks.",14-07-2022 15:38,36,Ra Ju

Saudi Arabia launched a devastating war on Yemen in March 2015 in collaboration with its Arab allies and with arms, logistical, and political support from the US and other Western states. Simultaneous with the invasion, the aggressors and their supporters also put the entire impoverished country under an all-out land, aerial, and naval blockade.

The objective was to reinstall the Riyadh-friendly regime of former Yemeni president, Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, and crush Yemen‚Äôs Ansarullah popular resistance movement, which has been running state affairs in the absence of a functional government in Yemen.

While the Saudi-led coalition has failed to achieve any of its objectives, the war has killed hundreds of thousands of Yemenis and spawned the world‚Äôs worst humanitarian crisis.

The Russian army has the most powerful nuclear launcher in the world ""Tu-22"" in all its versions, which can annihilate entire fleets.

The Tu-22M3 is the main long-range bomber of the Russian Air and Space Forces. It can accelerate up to 2,300 kilometers per hour. Its fuel reserves are sufficient to fly a distance of 5,500 km. The launcher can carry 3 guided air-to-ground missiles or 25 tons of aerial bombs.

But in addition to these advantages, the Egyptian military researcher Mina Adel confirmed in statements to RT that the secret of the strength of this launcher lies in the possibility of carrying two types of hypersonic missiles, ""KH-22"" and the nuclear version of it, ""KH-32"", as well as ""KH-47"". "", which made it one of the tactical solutions to support the Russian naval fleet against the European and American navies, which caused concern for this navy, especially after the recent naval training of NATO (polaris 21) in the Mediterranean.

According to the Egyptian researcher, the danger of such missiles, which caused heavy losses during training, appeared after simulating the characteristics of these missiles by computer to show the weakness of the defensive systems of the ships against them. The Russian Air Force is keen on the presence of this bomber in any naval theater in the Black Sea or the Mediterranean through the Hmeimim airport.

The Tu-22M3 grenade launcher weighs 100 tons, but it takes off from the ground easily and disappears in the sky after a minute. After the bombers and missiles take off, Su-30SM fighter planes take off into the sky, and they can deal with land or sea targets individually, but this time they head to the sky on another mission related to providing protection for the Tu-22M 3"" heavy.

The Tu-22M3 aircraft and accompanying fighters are flying in the skies over the Mediterranean at a low speed at a low altitude in order to be able to monitor the details of foreign warships whose mission has been set up in following up the training activities carried out by units of the Russian Navy in the Mediterranean.

Speaking at a news conference on Monday, Nasser Kan‚Äôani also said that the date of the next round of negotiations is likely to be set soon.

Kan‚Äôani stressed that Tehran has always supported diplomacy to restore the deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).

He added that Iran is serious about reaching a comprehensive agreement that guarantees its interests, particularly the economic ones, within the framework of the JCPOA.

Since April last year, Iran and the remaining signatories to the landmark deal have been engaged in marathon talks to salvage the accord, from which the US withdrew more than four years ago.

Kan‚Äôani noted that ‚Äúmessages were exchanged‚Äù between the negotiating parties in the past few days.

Referring to efforts made by France and other countries to bring the views of the opposite sides closer to each other, the spokesman said the Islamic Republic ‚Äúwelcomes any initiative that contributes to reaching an agreement.‚Äù

Tehran ‚Äúhas always been creative and flexible and present at the negotiating table,‚Äù he said, adding that it is ‚Äúpossible‚Äù that a date for the next round of negotiations would be agreed upon ‚Äúin the near future.‚Äù

""The Chinese People's Liberation Army is on high alert and will launch a series of targeted military operations to counter this, resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and resolutely thwart external interference and 'Taiwan independence' separatist attempts,"" Wu said in a statement.

The warning was made shortly after Pelosi arrived at Taipei's International Airport as part of an Asia tour, bashed by Beijing as provocative.

It was unclear where the Chinese military would target, or when it would take such action.

The visit by the US House speaker, who is third in the line of succession to the presidency and a long-time critic of China, comes amid deteriorating relations between the US and China. Beijing has repeatedly warned the US government against formal ties with Taipei, which is the sovereign territory of China.

Under the ""one China"" policy, nearly all countries across the globe recognize Beijing's sovereignty over Chinese Taipei, including the US, which nevertheless courts the secessionist government in Taipei, supports its anti-China stance, and supplies it with massive amounts of armaments.

JERUSALEM -- Israeli soldiers shot and killed two Palestinians on Saturday in an exchange of fire that erupted during a military raid in the West Bank, according to Israeli and Palestinian accounts, in the latest confrontation that has made 2022 the deadliest year of violence in the occupied territory since 2015.

The raid occurred in the Jenin refugee camp in the northern West Bank, the site of repeated clashes between Israeli forces and local gunmen and residents. The camp is known as a stronghold of Palestinian militants and the army often operates there.

Palestinian officials said soldiers entered the camp early Saturday and surrounded a house. In videos circulated on social media, exchanges of fire could be heard. The Palestinian Health Ministry reported two dead and 11 wounded, three of them critically. The official Wafa news agency said both of the dead were 17-year-old boys.

The Israeli military said it had arrested a 25-year-old operative from the Islamic Jihad militant group who has previously been imprisoned by Israel. It said the man had recently been involved in shooting attacks on Israeli soldiers.

It said soldiers opened fire during the raid when dozens of Palestinians hurled explosives and opened fire. ‚ÄúHits were identified,‚Äù the statement said, giving no further details.

WHO report found the Maiden Pharmaceuticals medicine may be linked to the deaths of dozens of children in the African nation.
Indian authorities have halted production of cough syrup at a factory of Maiden Pharmaceuticals, a state minister said, after a World Health Organization (WHO) report said the medicine may be linked to the deaths of dozens of children in The Gambia.

The health minister in Haryana state, Anil Vij, on Wednesday said the authorities inspected a Maiden factory near the town of Sonipat in the state and found 12 violations of good practices. Production was ordered stopped, Vij said.
The WHO said last week that laboratory analysis of four Maiden products ‚Äì Promethazine Oral Solution, Kofexmalin Baby Cough Syrup, Makoff Baby Cough Syrup and Magrip N Cold Syrup ‚Äì had ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù amounts of diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol, which can be toxic and lead to acute kidney injury.

Gambian police, in a preliminary investigation report on Tuesday, said the deaths of 69 children from acute kidney injury were linked to the cough syrups made in India and imported via a United States-based company.

It is one of the worst such incidents involving drugs from India, often dubbed the ‚Äúpharmacy of the world‚Äù.

News website Moneycontrol earlier quoted the Haryana drugs controller as saying in a report that Maiden did not perform quality testing of propylene glycol, diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol, while certain batches of propylene glycol did not have the manufacturing and expiry dates.

21262,"Europe turns to Africa for gas as alternative to Russia
Africa‚Äôs natural gas reserves are vast, and countries like Algeria have pipelines linked to Europe, but exports remain low.
A new liquefied natural gas project off Africa‚Äôs western coast may only be 80 percent complete, but already the prospect of a new energy supplier has drawn visits from the leaders of Poland and Germany.

The initial field near Senegal and Mauritania‚Äôs coastlines is expected to contain about 15 trillion cubic feet (425 billion cubic meters) of gas, five times more than what gas-dependent Germany used in all of 2019. But production isn‚Äôt expected to start until the end of next year.
That won‚Äôt help solve Europe‚Äôs energy crisis triggered by Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine. Still, Gordon Birrell, an executive for project co-developer BP, says the development ‚Äúcould not be more timely‚Äù as Europe seeks to reduce its reliance on Russian natural gas to power factories, generate electricity and heat homes.

‚ÄúCurrent world events are demonstrating the vital role that [liquid gas] can play in underpinning the energy security of nations and regions,‚Äù he told an energy industry meeting in West Africa last month.

While Africa‚Äôs natural gas reserves are vast and North African countries like Algeria have pipelines already linked to Europe, a lack of infrastructure and security challenges have long stymied producers in other parts of the continent from scaling up exports.

Established African producers are cutting deals or reducing energy use so they have more to sell to boost their finances, but some leaders warn that hundreds of millions of Africans lack electricity and supplies are needed at home.

The International Monetary Fund has cut its growth forecast for 2023 and warned of a cost of living crisis as the global economy continues to be affected by the war in Ukraine, broadening inflation pressures and a slowdown in China.

The fund maintained its global economic estimate for this year at 3.2 per cent but downgraded next year's forecast to 2.7 per cent ‚Äî 0.2 percentage points lower than the July forecast. There is a 25 per cent probability that growth could fall below 2 per cent next year, it said in its World Economic Outlook report released on Tuesday.

This is the weakest growth profile since 2001, except for the 2008 global financial crisis and the acute phase of the Covid-19 pandemic, and reflects significant slowdowns for the largest economies, the fund said.

Countries that account for about a third of the global economy are set to contract this year or next, and the world's largest economies ‚Äî the US and China ‚Äî along with the euro area will continue to stall.

‚ÄúIn short, the worst is yet to come, and for many people 2023 will feel like a recession,‚Äù said Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, IMF chief economist.

Advanced economies are now set to grow by 2.4 per cent this year, compared with an earlier 2.5 per cent estimate, after expanding 5.2 per cent in 2021. They are forecast to expand 1.1 per cent in 2023. The US, the biggest of the group, is forecast to expand 1.6 per cent, instead of a previous 2.3 per cent estimate and down from 5.7 per cent last year.

Rising consumer prices forced the US Federal Reserve last month to raise its policy rate by 75 basis points, its third consecutive three quarters of a percentage-point increase. The central bank is expected to raise rates again early next month, as it aims to bring inflation down towards its target range of 2 per cent. Inflation in the US, which reached a four-decade high, earlier this summer, hit 8.3 per cent in August.

Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin held a video summit on Wednesday, lauding bilateral ties as a pillar of multilateralism and hoping to boost economic engagement in a show of solidarity as Beijing and Moscow come under increasing pressure from the western bloc on issues like Taiwan, Ukraine and human rights.
Putin said he looks forward to attending the opening ceremony of the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Beijing and meeting Xi. He is the first leader of a country to do so in a show of strength with China against the backdrop of several western democracies announcing a diplomatic boycott of the Games over the state of human rights in Xinjiang.

China and Russia have come increasingly closer under strongmen leaders Xi and Putin, seemingly forming a bloc of their own against the US and its allies.

Putin won support from Xi for his push to obtain binding security guarantees for Russia from the West, a Kremlin official said, according to Reuters.

Xi addressed Putin as his ‚Äúold friend,‚Äù while the latter called Xi as both his ‚Äúdear friend‚Äù and his ‚Äúhonourable friend‚Äù as they talked about a wide range of issues.

21301,"Prince Harry moved his wife and son to California to break a #family cycle of ""pain and suffering"" after realizing his father Prince Charles ""treated me the way he was treated,"" he said in an interview released Thursday.

The remarks comes in the wake of Harry and Meghan's explosive television #interview with #OprahWinfrey, in which they raised allegations of racism in the royal family, and said Charles had cut them off financially.

Harry told ""Armchair Expert"" podcast host Dax Shephard that while he did not blame his father, he had resolved to avoid making the same mistakes with his own #children.

""When it comes to parenting, if I've experienced some form of pain or suffering because of the pain or suffering that perhaps my father or my parents had suffered, I'm going to make sure that I break that cycle,"" said Harry.

""There's a lot of genetic pain and suffering that gets passed on anyway. And as parents we should be doing the most we can to try and say, ""You know what? That happened to me, I'm going to make sure that doesn't happen to you,"" he added.

Harry said that once he began thinking about his father's own upbringing, he came to realize that the Prince of Wales had not had it easy, being brought up as a royal.

""So that means that he's treated me the way that he was treated. Which means, 'how can I change that for my own kids?' And well, here I am,"" the prince told Shephard.

""I've now moved my whole family to the US.""

The allegations made in Harry and Meghan's earlier interview with #Winfrey in March have plunged the monarchy into its biggest crisis since the death of #William and Harry's #mother, Princess #Diana, in 1997.

Harry and Winfrey will collaborate again for mental health #documentary series ""The Me You Can't See"" premiering May 21 on Apple TV .

Promoting that forthcoming series, Harry told Shepherd he had realized that he did not want his royal duties in his early 20s, in part because of ""what it did to my mom.""

""The three major times I felt completely helpless -- one when I was a kid in the back of the car with my mom being chased by #paparazzi, two was in Afghanistan in an Apache helicopter, and then the third one was with my wife,"" he said.

Harry and Meghan now live in #Montecito, around an hour north of #LosAngeles, and are expecting a daughter.

The Joe Biden administration has justified its decision not to invite Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela to the Summit of the Americas held last week (June 6-10) in Los Angeles by saying that these three countries are ruled by undemocratic regimes. Fine. Democracy is desirable and noble.But why did the Americans invite Jair Bolsonaro, who is an imminent and clear danger to Brazilian democracy? Are they not aware that the Brazilian president has made his admiration for military dictatorship and contempt for democracy publicly, eloquently and consistently on numerous occasions? He had glorified the army officer who had tortured Dilma Rouseff, the former Brazilian president.‚ÄúElections won‚Äôt change anything in this country,‚Äù an angry Bolsonaro told an interviewer on the programme C√¢mara Aberta, broadcast by TV Band in 1999. ‚ÄúIt will only change on the day that we break out in civil war here and do the job that the military regime didn‚Äôt do, killing 30,000 people. If we kill some innocent people that‚Äôs fine because in every war innocent people die.‚Äù Shouting at the interviewer, an intemperate Bolsonaro said that if he became president, he would dissolve Congress on his first day in office.
The Brazilian president‚Äôs admiration for military dictatorship extends beyond the borders of Brazil. During his visit to Chile, he praised Augusto Pinochet‚Äôs dictatorship, causing embarrassment to his hosts.

We have also had communication at the level of foreign ministers, the defence ministers, the NSA and his counterpart,‚Äù Bagchi said.‚ÄúThis has led to some progress as both sides successfully disengaged in a number of areas along the LAC in eastern Ladakh. We will maintain our dialogue with the Chinese side to resolve the remaining issues,‚Äù he said.As a result of the military talks, the two sides completed the disengagement process last year on the north and south banks of the Pangong lake and in the Gogra area.India has consistently maintained that peace and tranquillity along the LAC were key for the overall development of the bilateral ties.Each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the sensitive sector.(With PTI inputs)

Insulting remarks against Prophet Muhammad by leaders of India‚Äôs ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have triggered wide criticism from Arab countries, with experts saying the diplomatic backlash might be ‚Äúpotentially damaging‚Äù to the relations between India and oil-rich countries in the Middle East.

Last week, Qatar led a chorus of regional diplomatic condemnation as it summoned India‚Äôs ambassador and sought ‚Äúa public apology‚Äù from New Delhi over the insulting comments. The rare move came as India‚Äôs Vice President Venkaiah Naidu, a member of the BJP, was on a state visit to Doha.

China‚Äôs expansionism is finding new territories and unfriending new countries. Tajikistan, one of the smaller and poorer central Asian countries, has been worried since Chinese official media has repeatedly said in the past weeks that the Pamir mountains should be ceded to China.
An article by a Chinese historian Cho Yao Lu, using Chinese sources, says the entire Pamir region belonged to China and should be returned. While the apparent official endorsement has worried the government in Dushanbe, reports say the development has even drawn attention in Russia, which considers the central Asian countries to be part of its strategic backyard.
China and Tajikistan signed a boundary agreement in 2010, when Tajikistan was forced to cede about 1,158 sq km of territory in the Pamirs to China. China is building an airport at Tashkurgan near the Tajikistan-Afghanistan border, that is now a growing cause of concern. The Chinese writer says ‚ÄúAfter the formation of the newest Chinese state (1911), the first task of the authorities was to return the lost lands. Some of the lands were returned, others still remain under the control of neighboring countries. One of such very ancient regions is the Pamir, which was outside China for 128 years due to the pressures of world powers,‚Äù writes Chu Yao Lu.

So far, six air #shipments funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) have departed the US for India. These flights include health supplies, oxygen cylinders, N95 masks and medicines.

""We are helping Brazil. We are helping India significantly. I spoke to Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi. What he needs most is the material and the parts to be able to have his machines that can make the vaccine work. We're sending him that,‚Äù Biden told reporters at the White House on Tuesday.

""We're sending them oxygen. We are sending them a lot of the precursors. So we're doing a lot for India,"" he said responding to a question on his assistance to India, Brazil and other countries amid the second wave of the coronavirus #pandemic.

Biden said by 4 July, the US will send 10 percent of #AstraZeneca vaccines to other countries.

AstraZeneca vaccine is being used around the world but has not been approved for use in the US.

""With regard to the AstraZeneca vaccine which we had, we have sent that vaccine to #Canada and to #Mexico and there are other countries that we're talking to now. Matter of fact, I talked to a head of state today. I'm not prepared to announce who else we'll be giving the vaccine to,‚Äù the US president said.""

""But we are going to by the 4th of July have sent about 10 percent of what we have to other nations, including some of the ones you mentioned,‚Äù he added.

At the request of the Indian government, the USAID had earlier provided some supplies to the Indian Red Cross, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at her daily news conference.

""These are a lot of the components that the Indian #government has expressed a vital need for. More flights are on the way, with total existence expected to exceed USD100 million,‚Äù Psaki said.

""In terms of oxygen support which is a big component of what they need right now, we are talking about oxygen cylinders, so the USAID delivered approximately 1,500 cylinders that will remain in India and can repeatedly be refilled at local supply centers with more planeloads to come,‚Äù she said.

The USAID has sent approximately 550 oxygen concentrators to obtain oxygen from ambient air and it has also delivered large scale units to support up to 20 patients each of an oxygen generation unit, she added.

The press secretary told reporters that the Biden administration has directed its own order of AstraZeneca manufacturing supplies to India, allowing India to make over 20 million doses.

The US has also provided one million rapid diagnostic tests and last weekend, the USAID delivered 20,000 treatment courses of the antiviral drug remdesivir to help treat hospitalised patients, she said.

A group of experts from the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is headed to India. The group will work in close coordination with India''s public health experts in laboratory surveillance and epidemiology, emergency response and operations development, bioinformatics for genomic sequencing and modeling, Psaki added.

21338,"India plans to buy 33 fighter jets from Russia
India is planning to purchase 33 fighter jets from Russia amid ongoing border tensions with China.

Under the proposed government-to-government deal, Russia will‡¶Ü‡¶∞‡ßã supply 21 MiG 29 fighter jets and 12 Sukhoi Su-30 MKI aircraft to Indian Air Force (IAF). The deal is estimated to cost Rs60bn ($787.6m), reported ANI.

The proposal has been forwarded to the Indian Ministry of Defence for final approval.

According to a WION news report, Russia will assess the feasibility of delivering the jets in the shortest possible timeframe.
Currently, Russia is also working with the IAF to support the modernisation of MiG 29 fighters. The upgrades will improve the combat capabilities of MiG-29 fighters, as well as enable the aircraft to integrate new weapons and technologies.

The modernisation is expected to increase the service life of MiG 29 fighters by up to 40 years.

On the other hand, the Sukhoi Su-30 MKI aircraft is the only fighter in IAF arsenal that can fire BrahMos supersonic missiles.

21339,"Donald Trump took a solidly pro-Israel stance Tuesday amid an escalation of deadly Mideast violence, as the former US president accused successor Joe Biden of ""weakness"" and lack of support for the Jewish state.

""Under Biden, the world is getting more violent and more unstable because Biden's weakness and lack of support for Israel is leading to new attacks on our allies,"" Trump said in a statement.

Hailing his own administration as ""the Peace Presidency,"" Trump said Israel's adversaries knew there would be ""swift retribution if Israel was attacked"" when he was the US president.
""America must always stand with Israel and make clear that the Palestinians must end the violence, terror, and rocket attacks, and make clear that the US will always strongly support Israel's right to defend itself.""

The violence has killed at least 28 Palestinians in the blockaded Gaza Strip and three Israelis.

Several nights of clashes between Palestinian #protesters and Israeli police, particularly around the flashpoint Al-Aqsa mosque compound, spiraled on Monday night into a barrage of Islamist rocket fire from Gaza and deadly Israeli air strikes in retaliation.

The Biden administration on Tuesday called for calm and restraint by Israel and the Palestinians, and urged both sides to avoid ""deeply lamentable"" civilian deaths.
But ""Israel does have a right to defend itself,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs government says it will ban the wearing of the burqa and close more than 1,000 Islamic schools, the latest actions affecting the country‚Äôs minority Muslim population.

Minister for Public Security Sarath Weerasekera told a news conference he had signed a paper on Friday for cabinet approval to ban the burqa ‚Äì an outer garment that covers the entire body and the face and is worn by some Muslim women ‚Äì on ‚Äúnational security‚Äù grounds.

‚ÄúIn our early days, Muslim women and girls never wore the burqa,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt is a sign of religious extremism that came about recently. We are definitely going to ban it.‚Äù

A man who described himself as a ""monster"" after he ""tortured"" a kitten and bit off its ear has been jailed.

Aaron Williamson, 20, was jailed for 12 weeks at Grimsby Magistrates' Court last week after admitting causing unnecessary suffering to a kitten.

Williamson, of Westerdale Way, Grimsby, admitted repeatedly biting Litten's ear and punching him when he was angry, RSPCA inspectors said.

He was also banned from keeping animals for life.

It comes after an incident in September in which three kittens - including Litten - were removed from Williamson's address.

Inspector Kate Burris said: ""Williamson tortured this kitten.

'Sickening' daily abuse
""He admitted repeatedly biting Litten's ear, which resulted in the loss of most of it, and that he had lost count of the times he had punched Litten. He said he did it when he was angry.

""The district judge said his daily abuse of small, defenceless animals who were unable to harm him and were at his mercy was sickening.

""He said that Williamson had called himself a monster in interview, and that was accurate as to how he behaved.""

The kitten has now been re-homed in Derbyshire.

A Palestinian assailant stabbed and wounded an Israeli civilian near the Old City of Jerusalem on Saturday afternoon, before approaching two Israeli police officers who fired at the attacker, knocked him to the ground and then killed him as he lay on the road, videos of the confrontation showed.

The knife attack was at least the fifth in Jerusalem since the start of September, reviving memories of 2015-16, when scores of Israelis were stabbed by Palestinians in what some called the ‚Äúknife intifada,‚Äù a reference to earlier Palestinian uprisings against Israeli occupation. It also follows the killing of an Israeli tour guide by a Palestinian gunman last month, and a spike in violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank.

The nature of the assailant‚Äôs death on Saturday led to accusations that the Israeli police had killed him after he was felled and incapacitated.

In one video from the scene, which does not include footage of the initial attack, the stabber is seen being shot three times after dropping to the ground. The recording also appeared to show a third police officer signaling to colleagues to stop firing. The two officers, from the Israel Border Guard, were placed under investigation, the state broadcaster reported.

The UN children's agency Unicef has called on the Nigerian authorities to urgently review an Islamic court's decision to sentence a 13-year-old boy to 10 years in prison for blasphemy.
The boy was convicted in August of making uncomplimentary remarks about God during an argument with a friend in northern Kano state.
Kano is one of 12 Nigerian states practising the Sharia legal system alongside the country's secular laws.
Muslims form the majority in the north.
The 13-year-old's sentencing ""negates all core underlying principles of child rights and child justice that Nigeria - and by implication, Kano state - has signed on to"", said Peter Hawkins, Unicef's representative in the West African state.
On 9 September, the boy's lawyer, Kola Alapinni, said he had filed an appeal against the judgement.
""This is a violation of the African Charter of the Rights And Welfare of a Child. A violation of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,"" he added.
He told the BBC that no date had been set for the appeal to be heard in court.

Number of journalists jailed reached global high in 2021: CPJ report
A report from the nonprofit Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has found out that the number of journalists jailed worldwide was recorded to be at a global high in 2021. The report further found that at least 293 reporters were imprisoned as of December 1 this year, said news agency Reuters.
According to the CPJ's annual survey on press freedom and attacks on the media, 24 journalists were killed because of their coverage and 18 others died in circumstances that make it too difficult to determine whether they were targeted because of their work.

The report by the US-based nonprofit further said that reasons for jailing reporters differed from one country to another but the record number was reflective of political upheaval around the world and a growing intolerance of independent reporting.

""This is the sixth year in a row that CPJ has documented record numbers of journalists imprisoned around the world,"" Reuters quoted CPJ executive director Joel Simon as saying in a statement.

""The number reflects two inextricable challenges ‚Äì governments are determined to control and manage information, and they are increasingly brazen in their efforts to do so.""
Some of the journalists who were killed in 2021 include Danish Siddiqui, who died in a Taliban attack in Afghanistan in July, and Gustavo Sanchez Cabrera, who was shot and killed in Mexico in June.

According to the CJP report cited by Reuters, China imprisoned the most number of journalists (50), followed by Myanmar (26), which arrested reporters as part of a crackdown after its February 1 military coup, then Egypt (25), Vietnam (23) and Belarus (19).

For the first time, the CPJ's list includes journalists incarcerated in Hong Kong ‚Äì a byproduct of the 2020 national security law, which makes anything Beijing regards as subversion, secession, terrorism or colluding with foreign forces punishable by up to life in prison.
Mexico, where journalists are often targeted when their work upsets criminal gangs or corrupt officials, remains the Western hemisphere's deadliest country for reporters, according to the CPJ.

Dramatic escalation with airstrike in Iraq
A U.S. airstrike killed Qassem Soleimani, the commander of Iran‚Äôs Quds Force and a top Iranian general, which has sparked fears of escalation.
Vahid Salemi/AP
TEHRAN -- Iranian officials have warned of a ‚Äúvigorous vengeance‚Äù after General Qassem Soleimani, head of Quds Force of Iran‚Äôs Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), was killed in a U.S. strike at Baghdad's International Airport on Friday, and have swiftly moved to appoint a replacement.

Iran‚Äôs Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei described General Soleimani as the ‚Äúinternational face of resistance‚Äù and announced three days of public mourn in Iran for his assassination.

‚ÄúHis pure blood was shed by the hands of the cruelest of the mankind on the earth,‚Äù Ayatollah Khamenei said in a statement published Friday. ‚ÄúA vigorous vengeance awaits those whose hands are tainted with his blood,‚Äù he added.
The elite Quds Force of Iran led by General Qassem Soleimani have been carrying out unconventional and extraterritorial operations of the IRGC abroad. Soleimani has been running Iran‚Äôs operations in Iraq and Syria for a number of years.

Khamenei has appointed Brigadier General Esmail Ghaani, the previous deputy commander of Quds force, as Soleimani‚Äôs replacement
The White House said that the attack was launched on the direct order of President Donald Trump.

‚ÄúAt the direction of the President, the U.S. military has taken decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel abroad by killing Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force, a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization,‚Äù a White House statement said.
‚ÄúGeneral Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region,‚Äù it added.
While the U.S. described Soleimani as a threat to American diplomats and service members, Iranian authorities emphasized his role in fighting against ISIS on the ground both in Syria and Iraq, and called the U.S strike an ""act of terrorism.""

In a tweet, Iran‚Äôs foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif described Soleimani as ‚ÄúTHE most effective force fighting Daesh (ISIS), Al Nusrah, Al Qaeda et al‚Äù and said that ‚Äúthe US bears responsibility for all consequences of its rogue adventurism.‚Äù

Iran‚Äôs President, Hassan Rouhani, also denounced the U.S. attack on Soleimani, saying that ‚Äúthe great nation of Iran will take revenge for this heinous crime.‚Äù

In his sermon during the Friday prayer, Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami of Tehran said that ‚ÄúAmericans will not have peace anywhere in the world anymore,‚Äù Fars News reported. ‚ÄúComrades of martyr Soleimani will take sleep away from America and its allies,‚Äù he added.

For the first time, Ayatollah Khamenei has been heading the emergency session of the Supreme National Security Council held to discuss the situation, according to unofficial reports.

In addition to Soleimani, the U.S strike also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy commander of Iran-backed militias known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, or al Hashd al Shabi.

Others in the region are reacting to the targeted strike.

The Secretary-General of the Lebanese Hezbollah Resistance Movement, Hassan Nasrallah, said that ‚Äúwe will pursue [Soleimani‚Äôs] path and work day and night to achieve his goals.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt will be the responsibility, duty, and action of all the resistance fighters and Mujahideen throughout the world to take revenge from his criminal killers who are the worst villains of this world,‚Äù he said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe US killers, God willing, will not be able to achieve any of their goals with this great crime.‚Äù

In Iraq, Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi has denounced the assassination and warned of destructive consequences. He criticized the U.S. strike as an act of ‚Äúaggression‚Äù which could spark ‚Äúa devastating war,‚Äù according to Iranian Press TV.

21375,"Byju's and the other side of an edtech giant's dizzying rise
Digambar Singh says he has been chasing Byju's, an online tutoring firm and the world's highest-valued edtech start-up, for a refund for months now.

Mr Singh, an accountant, says he paid 5,000 rupees (¬£48; $66) up front and borrowed an additional 35,000 rupees - a loan he claims was facilitated by Byju's - to buy a two-year math and science programme for his son.

""A sales representative came to my home and asked my son all kinds of difficult questions which he couldn't answer,"" Mr Singh said. ""We were completely demotivated after their visit.""

He told the BBC he felt shamed into buying the course. But he claims he didn't get the services he was promised - including face-to-face coaching, and a counsellor who would call and update him on his son's progress - and that after the initial months Byju's stopped answering his calls.
Byju's called his allegations ""baseless and motivated"" and told the BBC Mr Singh ""was spoken to several times in the follow-up period"". They said they had a ""no questions asked"" 15-day refund policy for their product, if a student opts for learning material with an accompanying tablet, and an ""anytime"" refund policy for their services.

The company said Mr Singh asked for a refund two months after the product was shipped. But after the BBC brought Mr Singh's case to their attention they gave him the refund he was after.
The BBC spoke to many parents who said the services they were promised - one-on-one tutoring and an assigned mentor to assess the child's progress - never materialised. In at least three different cases, India's consumer courts have ordered Byju's to pay damages to customers in disputes related to refunds and deficiency of services.

Byju's told the BBC that they had reached a settlement in these legal cases, and their grievance redressal rate was 98%.

But a BBC investigation based on interviews with former Byju employees and customers has revealed several allegations.

Disgruntled parents allege they were misled by sales agents. They said they were lured into contracts by agents who convinced them of an urgent need only to go incommunicado a few months after the sale, making it difficult to get a refund. Once a sale is done, agents would be ""least bothered"" to follow up, a former Byju's employee said.

Former employees complained of ""pushy managers"", claiming there was a high-pressure sales culture that emphasised aggressive targets. There are also hundreds of complaints in online consumer and employee forums against the company.
Byju's denied using aggressive sales tactics and said ""only if the student and parent sees value in our product and develop trust do they purchase it"". They added that their ""employee culture does not permit any misbehaviour or bad behaviour towards parents"" and that ""all rigorous checks and balances are in place to prevent misuse and abuse"".

Founded by Byju Raveendran in 2011, Byju's is funded by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and major private equity firms such as Tiger Global and General Atlantic.

With schools being closed for more than a year-and-half, the pandemic forced millions of Indian students to turn to online classes. And the sudden switch made anxious parents like Mr Singh - who traditionally see education as an essential ticket to upward mobility - a crucial market for Byju's.

So the firm's ascent since the pandemic began has been nothing short of meteoric. It claims it added more than six million paying users, with a 85% renewal rate.

The BBC spoke to several students and parents who vouched for the quality of Byju's learning content - in a country where rote learning is often the norm, Byju's has been credited for deftly using technology to create immersive, engaging lessons. It also claims to have the industry's highest net promoter score (NPS), which measures customer experience and predicts business growth.

Byju's has raised more than $1bn since March 2020 and gone on an acquisition binge, mopping up a dozen competitors to become an umbrella holding company for firms offering everything from coding classes to coaching for competitive exams. It's possibly the most visible brand on Indian TV, with Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan driving its flashy ad campaign as brand ambassador.
But some education experts have questioned whether the company's rapid growth is a result of hard sales tactics that have fed into parents' insecurities, and added to their debt burden. Parents claim the tactics included incessant cold calls and sales pitches whose effect was to convince them that their child will be left behind if they don't by a Byju's product.

Given that even Byju's basic courses start at around $50 - unaffordable to most Indians - the company often pushed its product irrespective of whether the child needed it or the family could afford it, a former employee said.

""It does not matter if he is a farmer, a rickshaw puller. The same product is sold for a range [of prices]. If we see that a parent cannot afford it, we charge them the lowest price in that range,"" Nitish Roy, a former business development associate at Byju's, told the BBC.

Byju's said they have ""different products at different price points based on customers' needs and affordability"" and do not change prices in ""the manner suggested"". It also said sales executives have no control over pricing.

Several current and former employees also told the BBC they were often pushed to meet unrealistic targets. Two recorded telephone conversations which appear to show furious managers humiliating sales people for not meeting their targets surfaced online late last year and in January this year,

Byju's told the BBC the conversations took place 18 months ago and it took necessary steps to rectify the situation, including terminating the contract of those managers.

In a statement to the BBC, Byju's said ""there is no room for abusive, offensive behaviour in our organisation. The affected employee in the case referred by you continues to remain with us and enjoys management's confidence"".
But more than one employee told the BBC that the pressure to make a sale was so high that it took a toll on their mental health. One sales executive said he developed anxiety, and his blood pressure and sugar shot up during the year he worked at Byju's.

Several employees said 12-15 hour work days were a regular feature of their job, and staff who couldn't clock 120 minutes of ""talk-time"" with potential customers were marked absent, resulting in loss of pay for that day.

""That would happen to me at least twice a week. I'd have to make at least 200 calls a day to be able to hit the target,"" a former employee said.

He added that the target was incredibly difficult to meet because he would be given few leads to chase and an average call would often last less than two minutes.

But Byju's said it was incorrect to suggest that it ""either docks salaries or marks people absent if they fail to hit the target in the first instance"".

""All organisations have rigorous but fair sales targets and Byju's is no exception,"" the firm said. They added that mindful of employees' health and comfort, they offered a robust training programme.

""We have thousands of employees across our group companies and even in the case of a one-off incident, we immediately evaluate and take strict actions against mistreatment.""

But Mr Roy, who now teaches orphans in a school in Mumbai city, says he left Byju's earlier this year after a two-month stint because he was deeply uncomfortable with how the company operated.

""It started as a noble concept, but has now become a revenue-generating machine,"" he added.

Denmark's prime minister said on Friday her government would propose new restrictions to curb the rapid spread of coronavirus and the new‡¶Ü‡¶∞‡ßã Omicron variant, which now accounts for a fifth of all cases registered in Denmark.
""In record time, the rules of the game have again been changed,"" Mette Frederiksen said at a news conference, referring to Omicron.

The new restrictions, which will need approval from parliament, include closing of places such as theatres, cinemas, entertainment parks and conference centres.

It also proposed to ban the serving of alcohol after 2200 and urged Danes to limit their social contacts.

Denmark has registered 11,559 Omicron cases so far, the health minister said. Overall daily infections broke another record on Friday as 11,194 new ones were logged.

Death rates and hospital admissions, however, are still far below levels seen a year ago. Denmark's total death toll is 3,054 people.

21379,"Again it's confirmed!!!!!!!!
Reasonable to hypothesise Covid virus is genetically engineered
There is a possibility that the COVID-19 virus was ""most likely"" leaked from a lab in China, British MPs were informed on Thursday.
Harvard scientist Dr Alina Chan, while testifying before the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee, said that it was reasonable to hypothesise and investigate whether the Covid virus was modified in the lab.

The first cases were linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, which is located across the Yangtze river where a virology lab is located.

When asked by the panel about the probability of a lab leak as the origin of the pandemic, Chan said a ‚Äúlab origin is more likely than natural origin at this point‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe all agree that there was a critical event at the Huanan Seafood Market, that was a superspreader event caused by humans. There is no evidence pointing to a natural animal origin of the virus at that market,‚Äù she noted.
Speaking on the possibility of the virus being engineered in the lab before a leak, Chan said: ""We have heard from many top virologists that a genetically engineered origin of this virus is reasonable...and this includes virologists who themselves have made modifications to the first SARS virus.""

On the question of her level of confidence that the world would eventually be able to establish the true origins of COVID-19, Chan said it was simply a matter of time.

""Right now it's not safe for people who know about the origin of this pandemic to come forward. It might be five years from now, it might be 50 years from now, but we live in an era where there's so much data being collected and stored...we just need a credible, systematic investigation,"" she said.
""We know now that this virus has a very unique feature, called the furin cleavage site that makes it the pandemic pathogen it is. So, without this feature, there's no way this would be causing this pandemic.""

""Only recently in September did a proposal get leaked showing that scientists from the EcoHealth Alliance were in collaboration with the Wuhan Institute of Virology developing this pipeline for inserting novel furin cleavage sites, these genetic modifications, into SARS-like viruses in the lab,"" Chan said.

According to Tory lord Lord Ridley, who has co-authored a book on the virus's origins with Dr Chan, the fact that experts have still not located the animal host that would support a natural origin despite two years of investigation, supports the notion that COVID-19 emerged from a lab.Recent discoveries of China's attempted cover-up have compelled British and US intelligence agencies to investigate the lab-leak idea seriously, which was previously regarded as a lunatic conspiracy theory.
The explosive charges, on the other hand, are expected to put pressure on the UK government to question Beijing's assertions that the virus originated in nature.

They're also expected to raise more questions about Chinese President Xi Jinping's connection with the WHO, which was accused last year of issuing a whitewash report on the outbreak.

""It's like this every day,"" he yells out to us over their heads, ""it's been like this for the last four or five months... It was bad last year too, but not like this.""

The war in Afghanistan is over, but its economy is collapsing and at this hospital, in the remote, central province of Ghor, they're struggling to cope with the fallout.

International support, which propped up the previous government, was withdrawn after the Taliban takeover in August, whilst the country's foreign reserves, totalling around $10bn, have been frozen - chiefly by the United States.

Afghanistan has seen unemployment and food prices soar, whilst the value of its currency is plummeting and banks have set limits on cash withdrawals.
For the women outside the malnutrition triage centre in Ghor, life has always been difficult, but now it's getting even harder.

""We have nothing, no food. My children are sick and we don't have medicine,"" pleads one mother. ""Why aren't we getting any help?""

There are twice as many cases now compared with this time last year, one senior doctor tells us.

Inside a small room, a nurse wraps a measure around the stick-like arm of a young baby. It indicates ""red"" - the child is severely malnourished.

A joint military brigade of China‚Äôs People‚Äôs Liberation Army (PLA) has recently carried out a ‚Äúreal combat drill‚Äù involving anti-nuclear, chemical and biological warfare in Tibet in the backdrop of the ongoing Sino-India border tension in eastern Ladakh.
The exercise, including commandos, armoured assault groups and soldiers trained for chemical warfare were drawn from various wings of the army.

It was organised by the Tibet military region under the Western theatre command (WTC), the largest of China‚Äôs five commands that is responsible for the Sino-India disputed border, extending for 3,488 km from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh.

The news of the 24-hour long exercise held in late November was published in an official PLA news portal on Tuesday.

The article described in brief the nature of the drill and what the participating soldiers were responding to but did not specifically mention where the exercise was held. ‚ÄúA joint military brigade under the Tibet military area command held a real-combat drill on a snowy plateau in late November,‚Äù the article said.

Omicron: 5 things Dr Fauci says about this new variant of Covid-19
Scientists of the United States are actively communicating with their colleagues in South Africa to get more details about Omicron, the new variant of Covid-19, America's top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci said. Reports of the new variant have triggered panic and brought back fresh restrictions across the world. The variant is heavily mutated and is thought to be more transmissible than the previous variants.
Here are five things that the White House chief medical advisor said about the Omicron in an interview with CNN. Fauci was asked about the concerns regarding Omcron and whether there is any chance that it has already spread to the United States.

1. There are concerns over more transmissibility and the possibility of the evasion of the immune response. We do not know for sure right now. This is really something in motion.
2. The variant seems to be spreading at a reasonably rapid rate in the sense of when they do test positivity, it seems to be a bit more widespread than what was previously thought. It is in a fluid motion.
3. Anything is possible. There is no indication that the new variant is present in the United States. There is a lot of travel involved in how the variant spread from South Africa to Hong Kong. And so, we are trying to get the actual molecular make-up of the variant so that we can test for it. And that's something that will take time.
4. When you look at a mutation, it is going to give you a hint or prediction that it might evade the immune response. You need to get that particular sequence of the virus, put it in a form in the lab where you can actually test the different antibodies so you can have a prediction that it might evade or you can actually prove it. Right now, we are getting the material together.
5. You are talking about sort of like a red flag that it might be an issue but we don't know. Once we test, you can tell for sure whether it does or does not evade the antibodies that we make for example against the virus through a vaccine.

Eight mine workers were shot in a mistaken ambush by soldiers seeking insurgents, and six protesters died later in clashes with government forces, stoking fears of further violence in the restive region.
Protests and clashes raged on Sunday in northeastern India after 14 civilians were killed by soldiers, one of the deadliest outbursts of violence in recent years in a region long torn by insurgency and ethnic divisions.

Eight of the civilians were killed when a truck carrying coal miners returning from work was mistakenly ambushed late Saturday by security forces searching for insurgents in the Tiru area of Nagaland State, along the border with Myanmar, according to local officials. The Indian Army said that the soldiers had been responding to ‚Äúcredible intelligence‚Äù reports about the movement of insurgents, who often cross into Myanmar after attacking soldiers.

News about the killings spread quickly on social media and prompted residents in the area to attack troops and set two military vehicles on fire. After an Indian soldier was killed during the protests and street fighting, security forces opened fire on crowds, resulting in the killing of five more people on Saturday night. On Sunday afternoon, another civilian was killed by government forces after protesters entered an Indian Army camp.

In a statement referring to the ambush on Saturday, the Indian Army said: ‚ÄúThe incident and its aftermath is deeply regretted. The cause of the unfortunate loss of lives is being investigated at the highest level and appropriate action will be taken as per the course of law.‚Äù

With the harsh winter setting in, Afghanistan is staring at a major food crisis. In early October, India reached out to Pakistan to dispatch the consignment via the Wagah-Attari border near Amritsar in Punjab, but it hit hurdles because of India-Pakistan rivalry for which commercial and transport links between India and Pakistan are suspended for years.

21424,"Tear gas fired at protesters decrying Islamist attacks
Police in Burkina Faso have fired tear gas at people protesting against the state's failure to stop a rise in Islamist violence.

Some erected barricades‡¶Ü‡¶∞‡ßã and burned tyres as scuffles spread around the streets of the capital, Ouagadougou.

Authorities had suspended mobile internet services and deployed hundreds of riot police to stop the gathering.

There is growing anger against both the government and the French soldiers who are supporting the Burkinabe army.

Ms. Guo Yuanhe (70), a Hunan Province resident, was arrested in March‡¶Ü‡¶∞‡ßã 2020. In October 2020, she was sentenced to 4 years, 6 months in Hunan Province Women‚Äôs Prison for her faith in Falun Gong.

Since then, she has suffered countless torture tactics by Chinese regime authorities including: starvation, sleep deprivation, restricted restroom use, verbal abuse, brainwashing, straitjacket torture (pictured), and more.

Because of the torture, she was driven to mental collapse. While being treated in the Hunan Armed Police Hospital, she was also force-fed and lost eight teeth as a result.
